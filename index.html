<p>I used NGRAIN&rsquo;s Constructor SDK to put together a simple visualization of the distribution of confirmed exoplanets relative to Earth.</p>

<p>By no means a feature-rich interactive visualization, it&rsquo;s simple, powerful, and interesting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/bigRandomCube-300x266.png" alt="bigRandomCube" />Yesterday, I released a simple plugin, <a href="https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/random-3d-layout/">Random 3D Layout t</a>o the  Gephi Marketplace <a href="https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/random-3d-layout/">here</a>. It&rsquo;s very simple, and I developed it as part of my work at <a href="http://www.ngrain.com">NGRAIN</a>.</p>

<p>For anyone working in 3D in Gephi, this will be a useful and simple initialization layout plugin. Works well with the <a href="https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/force-atlas-3d/">Force Atlas 3D Plugin</a>. Without it and using a 2D layout to initialize instead, the 3D results can sometimes be milky-way-shaped, not generally spherical as you would expect, and ultimately not taking full advantage of the third dimension.</p>

<blockquote>As Augmented Reality (AR) continues to gain strong momentum, it is clear that data and information now have a physical 3D context, both conceptually and at the point of display. In the past, we were content with excellent 2-dimensional solutions for 2-dimensional displays, free to ignore 3D data viz as fraught with peril and difficult to execute. At a minimum, we must now wrestle with the challenge of presenting 2D visualizations in a 3D world. And, if we limit ourselves to that, we will fail.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If you don’t look at your data it can deceive you. That was true in two dimensions and is true above. If we live in a world of bivariate visualization we will miss important complex patterns because we are not looking for them. The third dimension must be considered when using visualization in analysis just as it must be rejected as a means to jazz up uninspiring pie charts.</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s worth announcing that last month I took a position as Data Visualization Lead at <a href="http://www.ngrain.com/">NGRAIN</a> in Vancouver, Canada.</p>

<p>NGRAIN&rsquo;s vision is to see beyond reality, and to help people accelerate decisions by interacting with the world&rsquo;s data in 3D. To make that concrete, we are currently developing cutting edge Augmented Reality applications for the industrial enterprise. 3D data visualization is notoriously difficult to execute, but in Augmented Reality we will no longer have a choice but to confront it, as our reality is 3D. Bringing my expertise to this problem will be an exciting challenge and will require great care.</p>

<p>What you see here will continue to be my own views and not those of NGRAIN. I will, however, likely be publishing on NGRAIN&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ngrain.com/blog/">blog</a> and cross-promoting here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just some shameless self-promotion. You can find my work cited in the CBC News from today.</p>

<p>Kazi Stastna writes <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sunshine-list-2014-ontario-s-list-drives-salaries-up-not-down-1.2592793">Sunshine List 2014: Ontario&rsquo;s list drives salaries up, not down</a> and includes:</p>

<blockquote>Ontario pathologists did just that and saw their Sunshine List salaries increase by 20 to 25 per cent between 2011 and 2012, compared with the 2.2 per cent average for the list as a whole, according to an [analysis](http://alekseynp.github.io/2013/04/19/20-25-raise-for-ontarios-pathologists-in-201-shows-sunshine-list/) done by data blogger Aleksey Nozdryn-Plotnicki.

Nozdryn-Plotnicki [found](http://alekseynp.github.io/2013/04/19/7-2-raise-for-1000-best-paid-ontario-public-sector-employees/) that this inflationary effect is greatest at the upper echelons of the Sunshine List, with the salaries of the 1,000 highest-paid workers rising 7.2 per cent between 2011 and 2012, compared with 2.2 per cent for the bottom half of the list.</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I tried to sell open government data, but I won&rsquo;t be the only one.</p>

<p>In 2013 I wrote a series of data journalism articles on the topic of <a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/topic-ontario-public-salary-disclosure/">Ontario Public Sector Salary Disclosure</a>. The posts were based on data made available as part of a disclosure initiative in the Canadian province of Ontario. Data was published freely and openly on the Ontario Ministry of Finance website in html and pdf format. I performed a convoluted scraping and processing exercise to build a definitive, unified data set and then performed some analysis in order to identify some interesting headlines.</p>

<p>In late 2013 I was approached by someone who was looking for the data behind my analysis. I agreed to share the data on a few conditions, one of which was non-commercial use that they were unable to meet. And so I offered to sell them the data. Free, open, public data.</p>

<blockquote>Sorry Aleksey. Not going to pay for public data even if private hours went into scraping it.</blockquote>


<p>I knew I had entered a moral landscape with shades of grey on a topic that people would be emotional about.</p>

<p>Government data should be free and open! After all it&rsquo;s our data for us! Well except perhaps in instances where user fees would be a more appropriate measure to spread the cost of data production more proportionally to those who will benefit. And the shades are grey.</p>

<p>My simplest and most direct defense is: My customer knew that the data was freely available, but I still had something to sell them.</p>

<p>Nobody owns the truth, but once they have measured it, processed it, and made it available in a useful format, then they have something that they could sell to you. If I sold you a map based on free government data or delivered you a service based on it, you would accept that.</p>

<p>I wrote about the <a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/2013/05/28/data-sins-of-the-ontario-ministry-of-finance-public-sector-salary-disclosure/">Data Sins of the Ontario Ministry of Finance – Public Sector Salary Disclosure</a> and <a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/2013/04/22/current-publishing-of-ontario-sunshine-list-not-good-enough/">Current publishing of Ontario “Sunshine List” not good enough</a>. This data was &ldquo;open&rdquo; but not truly &ldquo;open&rdquo; and it required considerable effort to process before I could analyse it.</p>

<p><strong>ProPublica</strong></p>

<p>Why I wrote this today rather than continue to procrastinate is that I saw this: <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/introducing-the-propublica-data-store">Introducing the ProPublica Data Store</a></p>

<blockquote>For datasets that are the result of significant expenditures of our time and effort, we&#8217;re charging a reasonable one-time fee: In most cases, it&#8217;s $200 for journalists and $2,000 for academic researchers. Those wanting to use data commercially should reach out to us to discuss pricing.</blockquote>


<p>And relevantly, they have data sets for sale based on data acquired through the American Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<p>Regarding:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbTb62BeTUc"> SAP Visual Intelligence: Big Data Example </a>on YouTube</p>

<p>First I had better say the positive things. I appreciate that this is a feature demonstration and not a case study. The presenter goes through the feature set of their product in an admirable and straightforward way. It is an impressive feature set and an impressive product. They are not trying to tell a story, so it is unfair to criticize their story.</p>

<p>Then I can say the &ldquo;but&rdquo;. But! I was struck by the badness of the visualizations. ALL of them! Some highlights are below, but you can watch the video for yourself and see not one well purposed chart.</p>

<p>The Visual Analytics movement seeks to democratize data analysis by making it easy to use and highly visual. They want to push analysis up towards senior management and outwards away from the analysts. Which is a laudable goal, but when we get there and people are creating stuff like we see in this video, we will have failed.</p>

<p>This illustrates two major calls to action:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Designers: How do you design a Visual Analytics product that guides its users to make good data viz design decisions?</p></li>
<li><p> Trainers: Go out there and spread the good word. Time to get <a href="http://visualisingdata.com/">Andy Kirk</a> in to train your organization!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>First of all, hats off to them for asking and answering important questions about modern society. The tldr; is that they ask &ldquo;Who had richer parents, journalists or people working in finance? Doctors or artists? More generally: What&rsquo;s the link between household income during childhood and job choice during adulthood?&rdquo; and based on a US government survey, they produced an answer.</p>

<p>They generate two elegant charts to illustrate their findings and I invite you to go to the article and see.</p>

<p>But something irked me about all of it and it took me some time to put my finger on it and ultimately it was the lack of extra commentary.</p>

<p>The first chart is a simple message: Doctors earn a lot more than their parents. Designers a lot less. But this isn&rsquo;t all that surprising given that we know what doctors earn quite a lot of money and designers don&rsquo;t. Even in a purely egalitarian society with 100% social mobility we would expect this. All of this tells us is that there is at least some social mobility. Not all rich doctors are born of rich doctor families.</p>

<p>The second chart is delightfully complex for journalism, but I felt even I, as a trained analyst, was struggling to get the right message out of it. Either I&rsquo;m having an off day, I think too highly of myself, or the readers are going to need some help.</p>

<p>Enter my adjustment:</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/social_mobility_final.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/social_mobility_final.png" alt="social_mobility_final" /></a></p>

<p>I&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&hellip; expanded the axes to include the full income distribution</p></li>
<li><p>&hellip; labeled the X=Y line for what it was</p></li>
<li><p>&hellip; added a Y=50 line to put the data into better context</p></li>
<li><p>&hellip; hand guestimated a line of best fit for the points so we could see where the United States sits</p></li>
<li><p>&hellip; made an important point about the lack of professions in the region left out of the original graphic</p></li>
</ul>


<p>An important and complicated question to answer is still missing: Nurses, for example, come of households at the 50th percentile. But is this all nurses coming from households all at the 50th percentile? Or nurses coming from households with incomes across the entire range, who on average are at the 50th percentile? If we knew the answer to that, then we would really start to learn about the potential for social mobility.</p>

<p>Ultimately they say that, &ldquo;These graphs aren&rsquo;t intended to answer broader questions about inequality and social mobility.&rdquo; But I don&rsquo;t see why they shouldn&rsquo;t be part of the debate.</p>

<p>Yes, the quality on this is not super high, but the point is to experiment with an idea.</p>

<p>There has been a lot of controversy floating around about a map.</p>

</ul>


<p>&hellip; to name a few.</p>

<p>The map being this: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/1y371s/">http://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/1y371s/</a></p>

<p>I have a thing for trying out abstract ideas in spacial analysis. Like:</p>

</ul>


<p>As a western Canadian, I&rsquo;m very aware of the east-west dynamics in the US and Canada, so I thought I would follow a hunch and make this map. I think it demonstrates nicely how lop-sided the US is.</p>
