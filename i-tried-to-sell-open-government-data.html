                    <p>I tried to sell open government data, but I won't be the only one.</p>
<p>In 2013 I wrote a series of data journalism articles on the topic of <a href="http://alekseynp.com/topic-ontario-public-salary-disclosure/">Ontario Public Sector Salary Disclosure</a>. The posts were based on data made available as part of a disclosure initiative in the Canadian province of Ontario. Data was published freely and openly on the Ontario Ministry of Finance website in html and pdf format. I performed a convoluted scraping and processing exercise to build a definitive, unified data set and then performed some analysis in order to identify some interesting headlines.</p>
<p>In late 2013 I was approached by someone who was looking for the data behind my analysis. I agreed to share the data on a few conditions, one of which was non-commercial use that they were unable to meet. And so I offered to sell them the data. Free, open, public data.</p>
<blockquote>Sorry Aleksey. Not going to pay for public data even if private hours went into scraping it.</blockquote>

<p>I knew I had entered a moral landscape with shades of grey on a topic that people would be emotional about.</p>
<p>Government data should be free and open! After all it's our data for us! Well except perhaps in instances where user fees would be a more appropriate measure to spread the cost of data production more proportionally to those who will benefit. And the shades are grey.</p>
<p>My simplest and most direct defense is: My customer knew that the data was freely available, but I still had something to sell them.</p>
<p>Nobody owns the truth, but once they have measured it, processed it, and made it available in a useful format, then they have something that they could sell to you. If I sold you a map based on free government data or delivered you a service based on it, you would accept that.</p>
<p>I wrote about the <a href="http://alekseynp.com/2013/05/27/data-sins-of-the-ontario-ministry-of-finance-public-sector-salary-disclosure/">Data Sins of the Ontario Ministry of Finance – Public Sector Salary Disclosure</a> and <a href="http://alekseynp.com/2013/04/22/current-publishing-of-ontario-sunshine-list-not-good-enough/">Current publishing of Ontario “Sunshine List” not good enough</a>. This data was "open" but not truly "open" and it required considerable effort to process before I could analyse it.</p>
<p><strong>ProPublica</strong></p>
<p>Why I wrote this today rather than continue to procrastinate is that I saw this: <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/introducing-the-propublica-data-store">Introducing the ProPublica Data Store</a></p>
<blockquote>For datasets that are the result of significant expenditures of our time and effort, we're charging a reasonable one-time fee: In most cases, it's $200 for journalists and $2,000 for academic researchers. Those wanting to use data commercially should reach out to us to discuss pricing.</blockquote>

<p>And relevantly, they have data sets for sale based on data acquired through the American Freedom of Information Act.</p>
