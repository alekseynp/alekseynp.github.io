Really guys?

Pie charts can be used to show a part-to-whole relationship with a relatively small number of parts. That is, if you have something that breaks down into 5 or so parts, then you can use a pie to show it. If you have 10 decades and they are ordinal, that is they have a natural ordering to them, then you might be tempted to do what The Economist did below... But don't!

All you have to do is try and use the chart at the top to answer simple questions like: Which is the most popular? More difficult, which is second most? How much more or less popular are the 50s vs the 80s?

Obviously I'm going to recommend a bar chart instead, which would have a different aspect ratio and might not work well in the space allowed by the graphic. A good alternative to a bar chart would be to put in a line in each of the charts representing the average result. I've sketched it below:
