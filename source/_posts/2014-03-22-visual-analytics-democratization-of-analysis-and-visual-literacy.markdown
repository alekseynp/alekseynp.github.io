Regarding:[ SAP Visual Intelligence: Big Data Example ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbTb62BeTUc)on YouTube

First I had better say the positive things. I appreciate that this is a feature demonstration and not a case study. The presenter goes through the feature set of their product in an admirable and straightforward way. It is an impressive feature set and an impressive product. They are not trying to tell a story, so it is unfair to criticize their story.

Then I can say the "but". But! I was struck by the badness of the visualizations. ALL of them! Some highlights are below, but you can watch the video for yourself and see not one well purposed chart.

The Visual Analytics movement seeks to democratize data analysis by making it easy to use and highly visual. They want to push analysis up towards senior management and outwards away from the analysts. Which is a laudable goal, but when we get there and people are creating stuff like we see in this video, we will have failed.

This illustrates two major calls to action:



	
  1. Designers: How do you design a Visual Analytics product that guides its users to make good data viz design decisions?

	
  2. Trainers: Go out there and spread the good word. Time to get [Andy Kirk](http://visualisingdata.com/) in to train your organization!
