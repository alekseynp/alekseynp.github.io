Just some shameless self-promotion. You can find my work cited in the CBC News from today.

Kazi Stastna writes [Sunshine List 2014: Ontario's list drives salaries up, not down](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sunshine-list-2014-ontario-s-list-drives-salaries-up-not-down-1.2592793) and includes:


<blockquote>Ontario pathologists did just that and saw their Sunshine List salaries increase by 20 to 25 per cent between 2011 and 2012, compared with the 2.2 per cent average for the list as a whole, according to an [analysis](http://thinkdatavis.com/2013/04/19/20-25-raise-for-ontarios-pathologists-in-201-shows-sunshine-list/) done by data blogger Aleksey Nozdryn-Plotnicki.

...

Nozdryn-Plotnicki [found](http://thinkdatavis.com/2013/04/19/7-2-raise-for-1000-best-paid-ontario-public-sector-employees/) that this inflationary effect is greatest at the upper echelons of the Sunshine List, with the salaries of the 1,000 highest-paid workers rising 7.2 per cent between 2011 and 2012, compared with 2.2 per cent for the bottom half of the list.</blockquote>




They are, of course, referring to my work:

For those outside of Canada, the CBC, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is a public entity and major player in the Canadian news media market. It's my personal number one source for Canadian news.
