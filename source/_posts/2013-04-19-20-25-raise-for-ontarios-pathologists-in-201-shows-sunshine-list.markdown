Evidence from the Ontario Public Sector Salary Disclosure, the so-called “Sunshine List”, shows that pathologists in Ontario saw an average salary increase in 2013 of 20-25% over the previous year. This average for the entire list was 2.2%.





Appearing in both the 2013 and 2012 disclosures, 195 pathologists saw their average package (salary + taxable benefits) increase by $57k or 20.6% from $280k to $337k.  The top 200 earning pathologists in 2012 averaged $348k, a 25.4% increase over 2011.





**Ontario Public Salary Disclosure**





Every year since 1996, the Ontario Ministry of Finance has released a list of all public sector employees who earned more than $100,000 in the previous year.





**Why?**





So what's happening here? Why are pathologists seeing a 25% raise while the rest of the list shows a very reasonable growth of 2.2%?





At this point all we have are hypotheses. Analysis of the publicly available data has uncovered a surprising feature, and further investigation is required to find the cause. This is exactly the sort of process we should expect from an open government/open data initiative like the Sunshine List.
