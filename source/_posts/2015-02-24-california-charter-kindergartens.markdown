In California, if your Kindergarten has the word "Charter" in its name, that says a lot about its measles vaccination rate.

* "Charter" kindergartens are almost twice as likely to have a measles vaccination rate below 92-94% for herd immunity. 
* "Charter" kindergartens have an average measles immunization rate of 83.8% compared to 91.8% in other schools.
* Personal Beliefs Exemptions were 10.8% in "Charter" schools compared to 3% in all others.
