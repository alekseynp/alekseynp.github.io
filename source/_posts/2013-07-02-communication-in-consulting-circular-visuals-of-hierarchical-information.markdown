Consultants need to communicate all of the time, and that isn't always making PowerPoint slides, though it can sometimes seem like it. Technical consultants often wrestle with surprisingly abstract concepts in fields unfamiliar to their client or parts of the client's organisation. While a consultant's role is partly to shield their client from that complexity, there will also be times where things must be shared with a wider audience.

One such abstraction that comes up again and again is a hierarchical structure or taxonomy of information. This is where an idea is broken down into categories, sub-categories and so on. These structures are often used in order to:



	
  * Ensure completeness – no item or category is missing

	
  * Break work down into manageable chunks – Work through a project one sub-category at a time

	
  * Organize an otherwise unwieldy collection of ideas – Bring structure to the problem (a skill highly prized in consulting job interviews)




**Case Studies**

Here are three applications that I have seen or been involved in...

**1. Data model**

Context: Business Intelligence change program
Organisation: Global manufacturer/retailer/distributor
[![data_model](http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/data_model-300x300.png)](http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/data_model.png)
Note: Sample content merely for demonstration.

**2. Process model**

Context: Siebel implementation
Organisation: Public sector organisation

**3.  Taxonomy of organisation's activities**

Context: Strategy/profitability projects
Organisation: Global organisation

**Circular layouts**

Circular or radial layouts are unpopular in data viz and for good reasons. When data is involved, the space, distance, size, and angles generally undermine the effectiveness of the visualisations. However, when only categorical information is present (i.e. no numbers) there are some significant benefits:

All on one page – It's critical that stuff fit all on a single page – large pages if necessary. Long Excel spreadsheet logs with columns like Category, Sub-Category, Sub-Sub-Category, Item, Description, Status are useful structures for managing complex work, but totally useless for communication. Radial layouts take tree-shaped information that would otherwise be a long and narrow list, and utilizes the horizontal space of the page, to wrap up the tail and bring it all onto a single sheet.

Engaging – In consulting it's important that your communication be engaging. You want as much support from your client's organisation behind your work as possible. You must win this at every opportunity from each individual who has their normal job that already consumes all of their time and energy and probably doesn't find your work as interesting as you do. Circular layouts look good, and this is important. You want someone to see it, say “Hey, what's that?”, and a take a step forward to have a closer look.



**Make your own**

I have previously published tools to the web for generating visuals of hierarchical data:
<table style="font-size: 10px; border-spacing: 30px;" >
<tbody >
<tr >

<td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: top; border: 1px solid #dddddd; padding: 10px; margin: 2px; border-radius: 6px 6px 6px 6px;" >[![](http://alekseynp.github.io/portfolio/images/info_wheel_4_alpha_icon.png)
Info Wheel
(4-level)](http://alekseynp.github.io/portfolio/create-visualisations/infowheel4/infoWheel.html)
</td>

<td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: top; border: 1px solid #dddddd; padding: 10px; margin: 2px; border-radius: 6px 6px 6px 6px;" >[![](http://alekseynp.github.io/portfolio/images/node_tree_4_alpha_icon.png)
Radial Tree
(4-level)](http://alekseynp.github.io/portfolio/create-visualisations/reingold-Tilford_Tree4/Reingold_Tilford_Tree.html)
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
I will publish more on special request.

Sure you could generate these visuals by hand in PowerPoint, and indeed many junior consultants are probably re-doing just that until 11 pm at night every time something changes. As much as they think they are gaining from the appearance of dedication that this creates, there must be a better way.
