Regarding:Â [Who Had Richer Parents, Doctors Or Artists? : Planet Money : NPR](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/03/18/289013884/who-had-richer-parents-doctors-or-arists)

First of all, hats off to them for asking and answering important questions about modern society. The tldr; is that they ask "Who had richer parents, journalists or people working in finance? Doctors or artists? More generally: What's the link between household income during childhood and job choice during adulthood?" and based on a US government survey, they produced an answer.

They generate two elegant charts to illustrate their findings and I invite you to go to the article and see.

But something irked me about all of it and it took me some time to put my finger on it and ultimately it was the lack of extra commentary.

The first chart is a simple message: Doctors earn a lot more than their parents. Designers a lot less. But this isn't all that surprising given that we know what doctors earn quite a lot of money and designers don't. Even in a purely egalitarian society with 100% social mobility we would expect this. All of this tells us is that there is at least some social mobility. Not all rich doctors are born of rich doctor families.

The second chart is delightfully complex for journalism, but I felt even I, as a trained analyst, was struggling to get the right message out of it. Either I'm having an off day, I think too highly of myself, or the readers are going to need some help.

Enter my adjustment:

I...



	
  * ... expanded the axes to include the full income distribution

	
  * ... labeled the X=Y line for what it was

	
  * ... added a Y=50 line to put the data into better context

	
  * ... hand guestimated a line of best fit for the points so we could see where the United States sits

	
  * ... made an important point about the lack of professions in the region left out of the original graphic


An important and complicated question to answer is still missing: Nurses, for example, come of households at the 50th percentile. But is this all nurses coming from households all at the 50th percentile? Or nurses coming from households with incomes across the entire range, who on average are at the 50th percentile? If we knew the answer to that, then we would really start to learn about the potential for social mobility.

Ultimately they say that, "These graphs aren't intended to answer broader questions about inequality and social mobility." But I don't see why they shouldn't be part of the debate.
