My US GDP/"Population" Map

[![us_east_west_gdp](http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/us_east_west_gdp.png)](http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/us_east_west_gdp.png)

Yes, the quality on this is not super high, but the point is to experiment with an idea.

There has been a lot of controversy floating around about a map.

I have a thing for trying out abstract ideas in spacial analysis. Like:

As a western Canadian, I'm very aware of the east-west dynamics in the US and Canada, so I thought I would follow a hunch and make this map. I think it demonstrates nicely how lop-sided the US is.
