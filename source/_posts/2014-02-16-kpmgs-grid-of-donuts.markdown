Another day, another poor visual. Apparently I have a quest to complete against bad visuals from consultancies. Today it's KPMG from this tweet:

A 4x4 grid of single-value donuts? Are you kidding?

Like [last time](http://alekseynp.github.io/2014/02/16/dubious-visuals-in-thought-leadership-from-consultancies/), I will show you how this is bad with simple re-design.

First let's try simply cleaning up the graphic a bit:

[![BgdOBnbIAAAJgsj-2](http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BgdOBnbIAAAJgsj-2.png)](http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BgdOBnbIAAAJgsj-2.png)

It looks better already! If I can improve your graphic by erasing the visual elements that you used to encode your data, this is a very bad sign.

And finally the obligatory bar-chart redesign:

[![kpmg data and analytics](http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kpmg-data-and-analytics.png)](http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kpmg-data-and-analytics.png)

Extra patterns become visible:



	
  * EMEA generally more pessimistic than Americas, Asia-Pacific of Overall

	
  * EMEA substantially less impressed by More sophisticated/granular insights


KPMG can [join Accenture](http://alekseynp.github.io/2014/02/16/dubious-visuals-in-thought-leadership-from-consultancies/) on the list of consultancies that should practice better data visualisation, especially when generating thought leadership on the topic of data and anatlytics.
