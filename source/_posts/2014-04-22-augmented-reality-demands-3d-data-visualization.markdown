I’ve just written a post over at the NGRAIN blog, [Augmented Reality demands 3D Data Visualization](http://www.ngrain.com/augmented-reality-demands-3d-data-visualization/)


<blockquote>As Augmented Reality (AR) continues to gain strong momentum, it is clear that data and information now have a physical 3D context, both conceptually and at the point of display. In the past, we were content with excellent 2-dimensional solutions for 2-dimensional displays, free to ignore 3D data viz as fraught with peril and difficult to execute. At a minimum, we must now wrestle with the challenge of presenting 2D visualizations in a 3D world. And, if we limit ourselves to that, we will fail.</blockquote>
