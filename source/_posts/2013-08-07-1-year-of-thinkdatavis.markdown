Today is the anniversary of thinkDataVis. 365 days ago was:[ It all begins](http://alekseynp.github.io/2012/08/08/hello-world-2/).

What do we take away from this? Well my older posts which were primarily projects scored the most pageviews. Time will tell if my how-to posts rise to the top in the second year. Also interesting that my Data Journalism content sees the least traffic, but [won me the most recognition](http://alekseynp.github.io/2013/07/28/my-ontario-sunshine-list-work-in-the-financial-post/) outside of the nets.

An interesting development: The defaults in Excel 2013 seem not so bad. The chart above is largely default.
