It's worth announcing that last month I took a position as Data Visualization Lead at [NGRAIN](http://www.ngrain.com/) in Vancouver, Canada.

NGRAIN's vision is to see beyond reality, and to help people accelerate decisions by interacting with the world's data in 3D. To make that concrete, we are currently developing cutting edge Augmented Reality applications for the industrial enterprise. 3D data visualization is notoriously difficult to execute, but in Augmented Reality we will no longer have a choice but to confront it, as our reality is 3D. Bringing my expertise to this problem will be an exciting challenge and will require great care.

What you see here will continue to be my own views and not those of NGRAIN. I will, however, likely be publishing on NGRAIN's [blog](http://www.ngrain.com/blog/) and cross-promoting here.
