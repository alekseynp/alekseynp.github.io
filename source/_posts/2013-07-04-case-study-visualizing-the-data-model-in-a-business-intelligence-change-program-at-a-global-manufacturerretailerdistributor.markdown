Example visual
[![data_model](http://thinkdatavis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/data_model-300x300.png)](http://thinkdatavis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/data_model.png)
Note: Sample content merely for demonstration.

**The Content**
The information model, structured as business function at level 1, entity at level 2, and data field at level 3.

**Context**
This global manufacturer/retailer/distributor was engaged in a program to update their Business Intelligence including their information model.

The client prized communication that was innovative, on a single-page, and not PowerPoint.

**What we did**
Made the visual, shared it, printed it and put it up on the wall.

**Benefits**
The visual was able to show people not just what the content of the information model was, but what an information model is. An idea that was only in a few people's heads was made concrete and accessible to others. In some ways those colours and that shape were an information model.

An abstract idea made physical, the visual facilitated meetings, as people could literally walk up to it and point at what things they were talking about.

By seeing it all in one place, people could realize what was missing and what was overlapping. Outstanding issues of data stewardship/ownership (i.e. What single level 1 category items belonged under) were out in the open where everyone could see, not lost in some kind of Excel issue tracker or somebody's meeting minutes. Who owns sales turnover, Finance or Sales? Sales turnover should appear only once in the visual under only one of the two level 1 categories.

**Make your own**

I have previously published tools to the web for generating visuals of hierarchical data:
<table style="font-size:10px; border-spacing:30px;" >
  <tr >
    
<td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:top; border:1px solid #dddddd; padding:10px; margin:2px; border-radius:6px 6px 6px 6px;" >[![](http://thinkdatavis.com/portfolio/images/info_wheel_4_alpha_icon.png)  
Info Wheel  
(4-level)](http://thinkdatavis.com/portfolio/create-visualisations/infowheel4/infoWheel.html)

Radial Tree

  </tr>

I will publish more on special request.
