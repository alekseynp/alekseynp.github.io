I've just written a post over at the NGRAIN blog, [On looking beyond two dimensions](http://www.ngrain.com/on-looking-beyond-two-dimensions/).


<blockquote>If you donâ€™t look at your data it can deceive you. That was true in two dimensions and is true above. If we live in a world of bivariate visualization we will miss important complex patterns because we are not looking for them. The third dimension must be considered when using visualization in analysis just as it must be rejected as a means to jazz up uninspiring pie charts.</blockquote>
