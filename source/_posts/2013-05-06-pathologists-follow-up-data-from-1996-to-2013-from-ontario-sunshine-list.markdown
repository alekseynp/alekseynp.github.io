This is a follow-up on my article, [20-25% raise for Ontario’s pathologists in 2012](http://thinkdatavis.com/20-25-raise-for-ontarios-pathologists-in-201-shows-sunshine-list/). Evolving from an explorative analysis of the 2013 Ontario Public Sector Salary Disclosure, the "Sunshine List", I identified a surprising change in the packages (salary + benefits) of pathologists on the list.

**Further Analysis**

Extending the analysis backwards to 1996, the start of the “Sunshine List” we can get a more complete picture of salary changes for Ontario pathologists.

[![pathologistsovertime](http://54.214.234.254/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/pathologistsovertime.png)](http://54.214.234.254/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/pathologistsovertime.png)

The analysis and the visual shows that:



	
  * Since 1997, pathologist packages have increased on average 5.5% annually

	
  * From 1997 to 2007, packages increased 6.6% annually and exponentially which was clearly unsustainable

	
  * From 2007 to 2012, packages saw little to no growth

	
  * In 2013, there was an unprecedented, single-year growth of 22%


**Contact**

I contacted the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. Their media relations passed me on to the Ontario Association of Pathologists, whom I had already contacted and have yet to see a response. A sensible strategy for them would be to ignore enquiries from bloggers regardless of if they had anything to hide.

**More**

You can read more on this topic in a[ piece in the Financial Post](http://opinion.financialpost.com/2013/07/08/terence-corcoran-the-sunshine-race-to-the-top/) which cites these findings.
