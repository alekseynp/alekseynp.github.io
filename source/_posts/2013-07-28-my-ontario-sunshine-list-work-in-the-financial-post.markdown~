A little late posting this, but you can find my work cited in the Financial Post from July 13.

Terence Corcoran writes [The sunshine race to the to](http://opinion.financialpost.com/2013/07/08/terence-corcoran-the-sunshine-race-to-the-top/) and includes:


<blockquote>"A quick and dirty snapshot of trends was recently highlighted by statistical blogger Aleksey Nozdryn-Plotnicki. Following release of the 2013 Ontario sunshine list, Mr. Nozdryn-Plotnicki’s posted a graph that showed big increases in the salaries of the province’s top 1000 income earners (see graph below). The highest paid individuals in the province recorded wage gains of 7.2% during 2012 “where everyone else saw 2.2%,” said Mr. Nozdryn-Plotnicki in a posting on his site, thinkdatavis.com. One year doesn’t make a trend, but similarly shaped graphs can be found for 2008, 2006, 2004 and 2000.

Another graphic example from thinkdatavis.com: Ontario’s pathologist salaries have increased 5.5% annually since 1996. During the first decade following the sunshine laws, pathologist packages increased 6.6% annually. That was followed by a four-year flat period. Then, in 2012, the pathologists recorded a single-year gain of 22%."</blockquote>


For those outside Canada, the Financial Post is a part of the National Post and [according to Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_newspapers_in_Canada_by_circulation) had a weekly circulation of 800,000 in 2011.
