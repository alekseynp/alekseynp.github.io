I’ve just published a post over at the NGRAIN blog, [Visualize confirmed exoplanets](http://www.ngrain.com/visualize-confirmed-exoplanets/)

I used NGRAIN's Constructor SDK to put together a simple visualization of the distribution of confirmed exoplanets relative to Earth.

By no means a feature-rich interactive visualization, it's simple, powerful, and interesting.
