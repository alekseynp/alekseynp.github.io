Over at [ThinkOR](http://thinkor.org), Dawen Peng [has](http://www.thinkor.org/2013/12/data-science-unicorns-superheoroes-scale-specialise.html) [been](http://www.thinkor.org/2014/01/building-data-science-team-vs-individual-summary.html) [writing](http://www.thinkor.org/2014/01/analytics-data-science-jobs-ads-done-right.html) about the need to approach Data Science with a team of diverse individuals with specific specialisations, rather than a homogeneous group of fancifully imagined Data Scientists who magically have deep specialisation in all possible fields.

Today she brought [this over at the Wall Street Journal](http://mobile.blogs.wsj.com/cio/2014/02/14/it-takes-teams-to-solve-the-data-scientist-shortage/?mg=blogs-wsj) to my attention:

_From Accenture, captioned: The 7 Skills of Data Scientists: Executives are struggling to find individuals who possess all eight data scientist skills and abilities. A data scientist team can serve as an alternative._

I've spent some time in organisations not dissimilar to Accenture, so I am familiar with this sort of thought-leadership-white-paper-graphically-stylish diagram.  While certainly beautiful, it fails to get any useful message across. I could go into technical reasons why, but I think the alternative that I threw together will demonstrate how much is lost in the original.

[![Accenture Data Science](http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Accenture-Data-Science.png)](http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Accenture-Data-Science.png)

Lost in the original is:



	
  * The diagonal pattern that shows the roles covering the skills

	
  * The comparison of the data scientist to individuals in the team

	
  * The fact that all people are expected to have at least low in the first four skills

	
  * That the Software Engineer and Systems Architect are the only individuals with Data Integration and Systems Administration skills

	
  * Once you remove the two skills unique to the Software Engineer and Systems Architect, almost all individuals have at least low in all skills


I've tried to [shame companies](http://alekseynp.com/2013/08/08/faux-pas-in-white-papers-visier/) that make gross visualization errors in their white papers before. Maybe it's time Accenture contracted an editor for this stuff? Especially when you are trying to write thought leadership that includes the role of Visualization in a Data Science team, you need to do this stuff well.
