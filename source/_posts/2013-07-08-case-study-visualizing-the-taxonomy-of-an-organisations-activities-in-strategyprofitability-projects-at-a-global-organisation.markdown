Example visual
[![activity_taxonomy](http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/activity_taxonomy-300x300.png)](http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/activity_taxonomy.png)
Note: Sample content merely for demonstration.

**The Content**
The activities of an organisation were broken down into four levels of taxonomy.

**Context**
The organisation was preparing to deliver strategy and profitability projects.

**What we did**
Simply put, we took the taxonomy and built the visual.

**Benefits**
With good reason, it is important to Strategy people that the concrete actions recommended by their work are underpinned by a good theoretical/abstract structure. This visual shows that structure giving everyone sight and confidence in it. Consultancies, often in the marketplace, often in white papers, want to show a completeness of vision and this did just that.

The taxonomy along with it's visual were useful for:


  * the project planning, structuring, and approval stage


  * project delivery, as activities could be build around the structure, and tracked against it


  * Take completeness of vision to completeness of execution


The condensed, all-in-one-page visual also supported development of the taxonomy. Workshops, edits and revisions were all facilitated by the visualisation. Otherwise people were restricted linear text, emails, Excel sheets, and other unwieldy mediums where duplications and missing items were hard to find.

**Make your own**

I have previously published tools to the web for generating visuals of hierarchical data:
<table style="font-size:10px; border-spacing:30px;" >
  <tr >
    
<td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:top; border:1px solid #dddddd; padding:10px; margin:2px; border-radius:6px 6px 6px 6px;" >[![](http://alekseynp.github.io/portfolio/images/info_wheel_4_alpha_icon.png)  
Info Wheel  
(4-level)](http://alekseynp.github.io/portfolio/create-visualisations/infowheel4/infoWheel.html)
</td>
    
<td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:top; border:1px solid #dddddd; padding:10px; margin:2px; border-radius:6px 6px 6px 6px;" >[![](http://alekseynp.github.io/portfolio/images/node_tree_4_alpha_icon.png)  
Radial Tree  
(4-level)](http://alekseynp.github.io/portfolio/create-visualisations/reingold-Tilford_Tree4/Reingold_Tilford_Tree.html)
</td>
  </tr>
</table>

I will publish more on special request.
