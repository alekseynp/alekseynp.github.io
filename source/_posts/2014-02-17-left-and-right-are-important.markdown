The major consultancies are turning out to be a goldmine for content for demonstrating the potential for improved data visualisation design. Today's winner is PWC, though their error is not terribly sinful and with some effort one could probably find something worse.

This is a demonstration of the power and importance of left-to-right. The original violates two assumptions readers make about left-to-right:



	
  1. Things further to the right are later in time

	
  2. Things further to the right are higher, bigger, better.


In the original 2014 is shown to the left of 2013 and the bars are ordered high, medium, low.

[The Original](http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/asset-management/emerging-trends-real-estate/european-investment-market-forecast.jhtml):

Quick answers to basic questions:



	
  * Are things good or bad? Bad. The bars make a download sloping shape.

	
  * Are things better or worse than last year? Hard to tell.


What if we simply change the left-to-right ordering of everything?

Left-to-right changes:

So now we at least get the impression that things are good before we start studying the labeling in detail. We can also scan across, say, the red bars in order to see how things are changing with time without having to realize that the chart's timeline is backwards.

I also experimented with a line design here:

  * Maybe the "things are good" message is a little muted

	
  * We can certainly see the trends over time, though. Generally flat, but with fewer doubters and a bit more optimists.

	
  * The central story of the graphic becomes the crossed lines in Business headcount. Unfortunately this is probably indicating an error in the original graphic. Scroll up and see the probably incorrect data labels
