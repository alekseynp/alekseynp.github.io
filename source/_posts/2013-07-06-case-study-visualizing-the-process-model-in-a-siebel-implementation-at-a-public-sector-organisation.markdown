Example visual
[![process_model](http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/process_model-265x300.png)](http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/process_model.png)
Note: Sample content merely for demonstration.

**The Content**
Business processes more or less broken down into Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, Level 4

**Context**
The client was designing a brand new set of business processes to go in hand with a brand new implementation of Oracle Siebel --  a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. Customers have accounts, things they need from us, things we need from them, processes to go through, etc. Go-live was approaching and confidence was low.

**What we did**
We generated an A0 (for North Americans, this is more or less 4x4 regular sheets of paper) circular visual of all of the processes being implemented in Siebel and put it up on the wall in the primary open-office space.

**Benefits**
On a single page we were able to both show that:


  * The problem was not infinite, could be counted, and could fit on a single, if large, piece of paper


  * There were indeed very many processes, and the size and complexity of what had been accomplished to-date was something the entire team could be proud of



Processes could be highlighted, coloured, or ticked-off to track progress.

**Make your own**

I have previously published tools to the web for generating visuals of hierarchical data:
<table style="font-size:10px; border-spacing:30px;" >
  <tr >
    
<td style="text-align:center; vertical-align:top; border:1px solid #dddddd; padding:10px; margin:2px; border-radius:6px 6px 6px 6px;" >[![](http://alekseynp.com/portfolio/images/info_wheel_4_alpha_icon.png)  
Info Wheel  
(4-level)](http://alekseynp.com/portfolio/create-visualisations/infowheel4/infoWheel.html)

Radial Tree

  </tr>
</table>

I will publish more on special request.
