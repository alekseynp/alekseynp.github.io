    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here is an <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/alekseynp/81a249e5e971750039dc">nbviewer IPython notebook showing an analysis of pathologists in the Ontario Sunshine List</a>.</p>

<p>It uses data from the <a href="https://github.com/alekseynp/ontario_sunshine_list">Ontario Sunshine List Scraper</a> that I made public on GitHub recently.</p>

<p>It recreates the analysis that went in to my previous article about pathologists on the list: <a href="http://alekseynp.com/2013/04/19/20-25-raise-for-ontarios-pathologists-in-201-shows-sunshine-list/">20-25% Raise for Ontario’s Pathologists in 2012</a></p>

<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll find it useful.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I am announcing my open Ontario Sunshine List Scraper released under the MIT License.</p>

<p><strong>You can download the data directly <a href="https://github.com/alekseynp/ontario_sunshine_list/blob/master/output/data.csv">here</a>.</strong> I will likely move this later.</p>

<p>Anyone can go <a href="https://github.com/alekseynp/ontario_sunshine_list">here to the GitHub repo</a> and download python code that scrapes the <a href="http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/publications/salarydisclosure/pssd/">Ontario Public Sector Salary Disclosure</a> data into a machine-readable format.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s version of the code has two key limitations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only the initial disclosure is scraped. Addenda are not scraped or processed.</li>
<li>2015 disclosure has not yet been published or included</li>
</ul>


<p>Please feel free to fork the repo and build ahead.</p>

<p>Anyone can create their own CSV like this:
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<li>&ldquo;Charter&rdquo; kindergartens are almost twice as likely to have a measles vaccination rate below 92-94% for herd immunity.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Charter&rdquo; kindergartens have an average measles immunization rate of 83.8% compared to 91.8% in other schools.</li>
<li>Personal Beliefs Exemptions were 10.8% in &ldquo;Charter&rdquo; schools compared to 3% in all others.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just some shameless self-promotion. You can find my work cited in the CBC News from today.</p>

<p>Kazi Stastna writes <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sunshine-list-2014-ontario-s-list-drives-salaries-up-not-down-1.2592793">Sunshine List 2014: Ontario&rsquo;s list drives salaries up, not down</a> and includes:</p>

<blockquote>Ontario pathologists did just that and saw their Sunshine List salaries increase by 20 to 25 per cent between 2011 and 2012, compared with the 2.2 per cent average for the list as a whole, according to an [analysis](http://alekseynp.com/2013/04/19/20-25-raise-for-ontarios-pathologists-in-201-shows-sunshine-list/) done by data blogger Aleksey Nozdryn-Plotnicki.

&#8230;

Nozdryn-Plotnicki [found](http://alekseynp.com/2013/04/19/7-2-raise-for-1000-best-paid-ontario-public-sector-employees/) that this inflationary effect is greatest at the upper echelons of the Sunshine List, with the salaries of the 1,000 highest-paid workers rising 7.2 per cent between 2011 and 2012, compared with 2.2 per cent for the bottom half of the list.</blockquote>


<p>They are, of course, referring to my work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://alekseynp.com/2013/04/19/7-2-raise-for-1000-best-paid-ontario-public-sector-employees/">7.2% raise for 1,000 best paid Ontario public sector employees</a></p></li>

</a></p></li>
</ul>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[I Tried to Sell Open Government Data]]></title>
    <link href="http://alekseynp.com/2014/03/28/i-tried-to-sell-open-government-data/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-28T19:13:28-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://alekseynp.com/2014/03/28/i-tried-to-sell-open-government-data</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I tried to sell open government data, but I won&rsquo;t be the only one.</p>

<p>In 2013 I wrote a series of data journalism articles on the topic of <a href="http://alekseynp.com/topic-ontario-public-salary-disclosure/">Ontario Public Sector Salary Disclosure</a>. The posts were based on data made available as part of a disclosure initiative in the Canadian province of Ontario. Data was published freely and openly on the Ontario Ministry of Finance website in html and pdf format. I performed a convoluted scraping and processing exercise to build a definitive, unified data set and then performed some analysis in order to identify some interesting headlines.</p>

<p>In late 2013 I was approached by someone who was looking for the data behind my analysis. I agreed to share the data on a few conditions, one of which was non-commercial use that they were unable to meet. And so I offered to sell them the data. Free, open, public data.</p>

<blockquote>Sorry Aleksey. Not going to pay for public data even if private hours went into scraping it.</blockquote>


<p>I knew I had entered a moral landscape with shades of grey on a topic that people would be emotional about.</p>

<p>Government data should be free and open! After all it&rsquo;s our data for us! Well except perhaps in instances where user fees would be a more appropriate measure to spread the cost of data production more proportionally to those who will benefit. And the shades are grey.</p>

<p>My simplest and most direct defense is: My customer knew that the data was freely available, but I still had something to sell them.</p>

<p>Nobody owns the truth, but once they have measured it, processed it, and made it available in a useful format, then they have something that they could sell to you. If I sold you a map based on free government data or delivered you a service based on it, you would accept that.</p>

<p>I wrote about the <a href="http://alekseynp.com/2013/05/27/data-sins-of-the-ontario-ministry-of-finance-public-sector-salary-disclosure/">Data Sins of the Ontario Ministry of Finance – Public Sector Salary Disclosure</a> and <a href="http://alekseynp.com/2013/04/22/current-publishing-of-ontario-sunshine-list-not-good-enough/">Current publishing of Ontario “Sunshine List” not good enough</a>. This data was &ldquo;open&rdquo; but not truly &ldquo;open&rdquo; and it required considerable effort to process before I could analyse it.</p>

<p><strong>ProPublica</strong></p>

<p>Why I wrote this today rather than continue to procrastinate is that I saw this: <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/introducing-the-propublica-data-store">Introducing the ProPublica Data Store</a></p>

<blockquote>For datasets that are the result of significant expenditures of our time and effort, we&#8217;re charging a reasonable one-time fee: In most cases, it&#8217;s $200 for journalists and $2,000 for academic researchers. Those wanting to use data commercially should reach out to us to discuss pricing.</blockquote>


<p>And relevantly, they have data sets for sale based on data acquired through the American Freedom of Information Act.</p>
