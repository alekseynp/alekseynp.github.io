    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I tried to sell open government data, but I won&rsquo;t be the only one.</p>

<p>In 2013 I wrote a series of data journalism articles on the topic of <a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/topic-ontario-public-salary-disclosure/">Ontario Public Sector Salary Disclosure</a>. The posts were based on data made available as part of a disclosure initiative in the Canadian province of Ontario. Data was published freely and openly on the Ontario Ministry of Finance website in html and pdf format. I performed a convoluted scraping and processing exercise to build a definitive, unified data set and then performed some analysis in order to identify some interesting headlines.</p>

<p>In late 2013 I was approached by someone who was looking for the data behind my analysis. I agreed to share the data on a few conditions, one of which was non-commercial use that they were unable to meet. And so I offered to sell them the data. Free, open, public data.</p>

<blockquote>Sorry Aleksey. Not going to pay for public data even if private hours went into scraping it.</blockquote>


<p>I knew I had entered a moral landscape with shades of grey on a topic that people would be emotional about.</p>

<p>Government data should be free and open! After all it&rsquo;s our data for us! Well except perhaps in instances where user fees would be a more appropriate measure to spread the cost of data production more proportionally to those who will benefit. And the shades are grey.</p>

<p>My simplest and most direct defense is: My customer knew that the data was freely available, but I still had something to sell them.</p>

<p>Nobody owns the truth, but once they have measured it, processed it, and made it available in a useful format, then they have something that they could sell to you. If I sold you a map based on free government data or delivered you a service based on it, you would accept that.</p>

<p>I wrote about the <a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/2013/05/28/data-sins-of-the-ontario-ministry-of-finance-public-sector-salary-disclosure/">Data Sins of the Ontario Ministry of Finance – Public Sector Salary Disclosure</a> and <a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/2013/04/22/current-publishing-of-ontario-sunshine-list-not-good-enough/">Current publishing of Ontario “Sunshine List” not good enough</a>. This data was &ldquo;open&rdquo; but not truly &ldquo;open&rdquo; and it required considerable effort to process before I could analyse it.</p>

<p><strong>ProPublica</strong></p>

<p>Why I wrote this today rather than continue to procrastinate is that I saw this: <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/introducing-the-propublica-data-store">Introducing the ProPublica Data Store</a></p>

<blockquote>For datasets that are the result of significant expenditures of our time and effort, we&#8217;re charging a reasonable one-time fee: In most cases, it&#8217;s $200 for journalists and $2,000 for academic researchers. Those wanting to use data commercially should reach out to us to discuss pricing.</blockquote>


<p>And relevantly, they have data sets for sale based on data acquired through the American Freedom of Information Act.</p>

    <id>http://alekseynp.github.io/2013/07/27/texas-death-row-execution-data</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Andy Kirk over at <a href="http://www.visualisingdata.com/">Visualising Data</a> wrote recently about the <a href="http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2013/07/texas-death-row-execution-data/">Texas Death Row Education Data</a>. Texas has executed it&rsquo;s 500th person since it began executing people again and provides a <a href="http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/stat/dr_executed_offenders.html">wealth of data</a> about those people. Andy shared <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArNsipRBvi69dEUxZHVuRTc4ZlctREdldExsOW5rMUE#gid=0">a working copy the data </a>as scraped from the site. I&rsquo;m moving the ball forward here by sharing my updated copy of the data.</p>

<p>You can find my dataset here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AohPSKdfKZm1dE8tZlpZeWtIT1dDckFrTUZucG1sY3c#gid=0">get the data</a></p>

<p>Much of the data is stored in images and I have not processed those, so this is why there are empty rows. Probably a manual affair, though anyone who is a wiz with OCR (optical character recognition) may want to do this as an exercise.</p>

<p>I have not yet standardised the data. When I have time, I will write regular expressions to standardize the height data, for example.</p>

<p>How I scraped this data is a topic for another post.  I used my weapon of choice, C# and modified code I had written for other projects.</p>
