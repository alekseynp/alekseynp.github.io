    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I am announcing my open Ontario Sunshine List Scraper released under the MIT License.</p>

<p><strong>You can download the data directly <a href="https://github.com/alekseynp/ontario_sunshine_list/blob/master/output/data.csv">here</a>.</strong> I will likely move this later.</p>

<p>Anyone can go <a href="https://github.com/alekseynp/ontario_sunshine_list">here</a> and download python code that scrapes the <a href="http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/publications/salarydisclosure/pssd/">Ontario Public Sector Salary Disclosure</a> data into a machine-readable format.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s version of the code has two key limitations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only the initial disclosure is scraped. Addenda are not scraped or processed.</li>
<li>2015 disclosure has not yet been published or included</li>
</ul>


<p>Please feel free to fork the repo and build ahead.</p>

<p>Anyone can create their own CSV like this:
<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just some shameless self-promotion. You can find my work cited in the CBC News from today.</p>

<p>Kazi Stastna writes <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sunshine-list-2014-ontario-s-list-drives-salaries-up-not-down-1.2592793">Sunshine List 2014: Ontario&rsquo;s list drives salaries up, not down</a> and includes:</p>

<blockquote>Ontario pathologists did just that and saw their Sunshine List salaries increase by 20 to 25 per cent between 2011 and 2012, compared with the 2.2 per cent average for the list as a whole, according to an [analysis](http://alekseynp.com/2013/04/19/20-25-raise-for-ontarios-pathologists-in-201-shows-sunshine-list/) done by data blogger Aleksey Nozdryn-Plotnicki.

&#8230;

Nozdryn-Plotnicki [found](http://alekseynp.com/2013/04/19/7-2-raise-for-1000-best-paid-ontario-public-sector-employees/) that this inflationary effect is greatest at the upper echelons of the Sunshine List, with the salaries of the 1,000 highest-paid workers rising 7.2 per cent between 2011 and 2012, compared with 2.2 per cent for the bottom half of the list.</blockquote>


<p>They are, of course, referring to my work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://alekseynp.com/2013/04/19/7-2-raise-for-1000-best-paid-ontario-public-sector-employees/">7.2% raise for 1,000 best paid Ontario public sector employees</a></p></li>

    <link href="http://alekseynp.com/2014/03/28/i-tried-to-sell-open-government-data/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-28T19:13:28-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://alekseynp.com/2014/03/28/i-tried-to-sell-open-government-data</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I tried to sell open government data, but I won&rsquo;t be the only one.</p>

<p>In 2013 I wrote a series of data journalism articles on the topic of <a href="http://alekseynp.com/topic-ontario-public-salary-disclosure/">Ontario Public Sector Salary Disclosure</a>. The posts were based on data made available as part of a disclosure initiative in the Canadian province of Ontario. Data was published freely and openly on the Ontario Ministry of Finance website in html and pdf format. I performed a convoluted scraping and processing exercise to build a definitive, unified data set and then performed some analysis in order to identify some interesting headlines.</p>

<p>In late 2013 I was approached by someone who was looking for the data behind my analysis. I agreed to share the data on a few conditions, one of which was non-commercial use that they were unable to meet. And so I offered to sell them the data. Free, open, public data.</p>

<blockquote>Sorry Aleksey. Not going to pay for public data even if private hours went into scraping it.</blockquote>


<p>I knew I had entered a moral landscape with shades of grey on a topic that people would be emotional about.</p>

<p>Government data should be free and open! After all it&rsquo;s our data for us! Well except perhaps in instances where user fees would be a more appropriate measure to spread the cost of data production more proportionally to those who will benefit. And the shades are grey.</p>

<p>My simplest and most direct defense is: My customer knew that the data was freely available, but I still had something to sell them.</p>

<p>Nobody owns the truth, but once they have measured it, processed it, and made it available in a useful format, then they have something that they could sell to you. If I sold you a map based on free government data or delivered you a service based on it, you would accept that.</p>

<p>I wrote about the <a href="http://alekseynp.com/2013/05/27/data-sins-of-the-ontario-ministry-of-finance-public-sector-salary-disclosure/">Data Sins of the Ontario Ministry of Finance – Public Sector Salary Disclosure</a> and <a href="http://alekseynp.com/2013/04/22/current-publishing-of-ontario-sunshine-list-not-good-enough/">Current publishing of Ontario “Sunshine List” not good enough</a>. This data was &ldquo;open&rdquo; but not truly &ldquo;open&rdquo; and it required considerable effort to process before I could analyse it.</p>

<p><strong>ProPublica</strong></p>

<p>Why I wrote this today rather than continue to procrastinate is that I saw this: <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/introducing-the-propublica-data-store">Introducing the ProPublica Data Store</a></p>

<blockquote>For datasets that are the result of significant expenditures of our time and effort, we&#8217;re charging a reasonable one-time fee: In most cases, it&#8217;s $200 for journalists and $2,000 for academic researchers. Those wanting to use data commercially should reach out to us to discuss pricing.</blockquote>


<p>And relevantly, they have data sets for sale based on data acquired through the American Freedom of Information Act.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A little late posting this, but you can find my work cited in the Financial Post from July 13.</p>

<p>Terence Corcoran writes <a href="http://opinion.financialpost.com/2013/07/08/terence-corcoran-the-sunshine-race-to-the-top/">The sunshine race to the to</a> and includes:</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;A quick and dirty snapshot of trends was recently highlighted by statistical blogger Aleksey Nozdryn-Plotnicki. Following release of the 2013 Ontario sunshine list, Mr. Nozdryn-Plotnicki’s posted a graph that showed big increases in the salaries of the province’s top 1000 income earners (see graph below). The highest paid individuals in the province recorded wage gains of 7.2% during 2012 “where everyone else saw 2.2%,” said Mr. Nozdryn-Plotnicki in a posting on his site, thinkdatavis.com. One year doesn’t make a trend, but similarly shaped graphs can be found for 2008, 2006, 2004 and 2000.

Another graphic example from thinkdatavis.com: Ontario’s pathologist salaries have increased 5.5% annually since 1996. During the first decade following the sunshine laws, pathologist packages increased 6.6% annually. That was followed by a four-year flat period. Then, in 2012, the pathologists recorded a single-year gain of 22%.&#8221;</blockquote>


<p>For those outside Canada, the Financial Post is a part of the National Post and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_newspapers_in_Canada_by_circulation">according to Wikipedia</a> had a weekly circulation of 800,000 in 2011.</p>

    <id>http://alekseynp.com/2013/07/12/the-sun-shines-fondly-on-ontario-university-presidents</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since 1996, the ten best paid Ontario university presidents have seen their packages increased on average about 5.1% annually. This compares to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>4.0% for the 10,000th best paid person on the Sunshine List since 2001 (when there first were 10,000 names on the list)</p></li>
<li><p>3.5% annually for the 20,000th best paid since 2004</p></li>
<li><p>5.5% annually for Pathologists since 1996</p></li>
</ul>


<p>While not as shocking as the single-year 22% raise that I <a href="http://alekseynp.com/2013/04/19/20-25-raise-for-ontarios-pathologists-in-201-shows-sunshine-list/">previously identified for pathologists</a>, this is evidence that university presidents are in the elite club for whom the sun shines strongly. As I have <a href="http://alekseynp.com/2013/05/06/second-largest-growth-gap-in-2012-for-ontario-sunshine-list/">shown previously</a>, those at the top in Ontario not only higher salaries, and bigger raises in absolute dollars, but also larger percentage increases annually which compound and lead to bigger gap between them and everyone else.</p>

<p>Explore the data below:</p>

<p><strong>Questions and Answers</strong></p>

<p>Why are there sudden dips in the lines?</p>

<p>For example, Brock in 2007 and Carleton in 2006 and 2009. When an outgoing or incoming president works only a portion of a year, they earn less and are reported as less.</p>

<p>Why is there missing years sometimes?</p>

<p>As with sudden dips in the lines, if both the outgoing and incoming presidents work only a portion of the year and only earn less than $100,000, they will not qualify for disclosure and there will be no data for them. Also in some years the data may be outright missing.</p>

<p>Why is there almost no data for Queen’s?</p>

<p>I struggled to identify presidents of Queen’s in the data. Perhaps their structure is different. I took Daniel R. Woolf, Principal - Principal&rsquo;s Office for 2013, and Wade G. Hall, Executive Director Development for 2010 and 2009, but this is probably wrong. Any experts on the structure can feel free to inform me and I can make the appropriate correction.</p>

<p>Why do many lines start after 1997?</p>

<p>Before this period, the given presidents did not earn more than $100,000 and did not qualify for disclosure.</p>
