    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here is an <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/alekseynp/81a249e5e971750039dc">nbviewer IPython notebook showing an analysis of pathologists in the Ontario Sunshine List</a>.</p>

<p>It uses data from the <a href="https://github.com/alekseynp/ontario_sunshine_list">Ontario Sunshine List Scraper</a> that I made public on GitHub recently.</p>

<p>It recreates the analysis that went in to my previous article about pathologists on the list: <a href="http://alekseynp.com/2013/04/19/20-25-raise-for-ontarios-pathologists-in-201-shows-sunshine-list/">20-25% Raise for Ontario’s Pathologists in 2012</a></p>

<p>I hope you&rsquo;ll find it useful.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I am announcing my open Ontario Sunshine List Scraper released under the MIT License.</p>

<p><strong>You can download the data directly <a href="https://github.com/alekseynp/ontario_sunshine_list/blob/master/output/data.csv">here</a>.</strong> I will likely move this later.</p>

<p>Anyone can go <a href="https://github.com/alekseynp/ontario_sunshine_list">here to the GitHub repo</a> and download python code that scrapes the <a href="http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/publications/salarydisclosure/pssd/">Ontario Public Sector Salary Disclosure</a> data into a machine-readable format.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s version of the code has two key limitations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Only the initial disclosure is scraped. Addenda are not scraped or processed.</li>
<li>2015 disclosure has not yet been published or included</li>
</ul>


<p>Please feel free to fork the repo and build ahead.</p>

<p>Anyone can create their own CSV like this:

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just some shameless self-promotion. You can find my work cited in the CBC News from today.</p>

<p>Kazi Stastna writes <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sunshine-list-2014-ontario-s-list-drives-salaries-up-not-down-1.2592793">Sunshine List 2014: Ontario&rsquo;s list drives salaries up, not down</a> and includes:</p>

<blockquote>Ontario pathologists did just that and saw their Sunshine List salaries increase by 20 to 25 per cent between 2011 and 2012, compared with the 2.2 per cent average for the list as a whole, according to an [analysis](http://alekseynp.com/2013/04/19/20-25-raise-for-ontarios-pathologists-in-201-shows-sunshine-list/) done by data blogger Aleksey Nozdryn-Plotnicki.

&#8230;

Nozdryn-Plotnicki [found](http://alekseynp.com/2013/04/19/7-2-raise-for-1000-best-paid-ontario-public-sector-employees/) that this inflationary effect is greatest at the upper echelons of the Sunshine List, with the salaries of the 1,000 highest-paid workers rising 7.2 per cent between 2011 and 2012, compared with 2.2 per cent for the bottom half of the list.</blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A little late posting this, but you can find my work cited in the Financial Post from July 13.</p>

<p>Terence Corcoran writes <a href="http://opinion.financialpost.com/2013/07/08/terence-corcoran-the-sunshine-race-to-the-top/">The sunshine race to the to</a> and includes:</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;A quick and dirty snapshot of trends was recently highlighted by statistical blogger Aleksey Nozdryn-Plotnicki. Following release of the 2013 Ontario sunshine list, Mr. Nozdryn-Plotnicki’s posted a graph that showed big increases in the salaries of the province’s top 1000 income earners (see graph below). The highest paid individuals in the province recorded wage gains of 7.2% during 2012 “where everyone else saw 2.2%,” said Mr. Nozdryn-Plotnicki in a posting on his site, thinkdatavis.com. One year doesn’t make a trend, but similarly shaped graphs can be found for 2008, 2006, 2004 and 2000.

Another graphic example from thinkdatavis.com: Ontario’s pathologist salaries have increased 5.5% annually since 1996. During the first decade following the sunshine laws, pathologist packages increased 6.6% annually. That was followed by a four-year flat period. Then, in 2012, the pathologists recorded a single-year gain of 22%.&#8221;</blockquote>

    <id>http://alekseynp.com/2013/07/12/the-sun-shines-fondly-on-ontario-university-presidents</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since 1996, the ten best paid Ontario university presidents have seen their packages increased on average about 5.1% annually. This compares to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>4.0% for the 10,000th best paid person on the Sunshine List since 2001 (when there first were 10,000 names on the list)</p></li>
<li><p>3.5% annually for the 20,000th best paid since 2004</p></li>
<li><p>5.5% annually for Pathologists since 1996</p></li>
</ul>


<p>While not as shocking as the single-year 22% raise that I <a href="http://alekseynp.com/2013/04/19/20-25-raise-for-ontarios-pathologists-in-201-shows-sunshine-list/">previously identified for pathologists</a>, this is evidence that university presidents are in the elite club for whom the sun shines strongly. As I have <a href="http://alekseynp.com/2013/05/06/second-largest-growth-gap-in-2012-for-ontario-sunshine-list/">shown previously</a>, those at the top in Ontario not only higher salaries, and bigger raises in absolute dollars, but also larger percentage increases annually which compound and lead to bigger gap between them and everyone else.</p>

<p><strong>Questions and Answers</strong></p>

<p>Why are there sudden dips in the lines?</p>

<p>For example, Brock in 2007 and Carleton in 2006 and 2009. When an outgoing or incoming president works only a portion of a year, they earn less and are reported as less.</p>

<p>Why is there missing years sometimes?</p>

<p>As with sudden dips in the lines, if both the outgoing and incoming presidents work only a portion of the year and only earn less than $100,000, they will not qualify for disclosure and there will be no data for them. Also in some years the data may be outright missing.</p>

<p>Why is there almost no data for Queen’s?</p>

<p>I struggled to identify presidents of Queen’s in the data. Perhaps their structure is different. I took Daniel R. Woolf, Principal - Principal&rsquo;s Office for 2013, and Wade G. Hall, Executive Director Development for 2010 and 2009, but this is probably wrong. Any experts on the structure can feel free to inform me and I can make the appropriate correction.</p>

<p>Why do many lines start after 1997?</p>

<p>Before this period, the given presidents did not earn more than $100,000 and did not qualify for disclosure.</p>
