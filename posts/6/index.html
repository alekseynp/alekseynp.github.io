  <div class="entry-content"><p>Standing where we are in 2013, the Public Services Salary Disclosure Act of 1996 in Ontario seems ahead of it&rsquo;s time in terms of open government data. 17 consecutive lists published of all public sector employees who earned more than $100,000 in a year. But, what was once a bold step forward in terms of public accountability, is now falling behind in other ways.</p>

<p>By today&rsquo;s standards, publishing an intimidatingly long list of approaching 100,000 names and salaries across 100 or so HTML or PDF pages does not constitute disclosure. Sure, it&rsquo;s great if you want to look up how much your boss makes or to keep an eye on the salaries of TVO presenters, but after that it falters. Making data possible to access, and making it easy to access are different things. If the data were published in print, but not made available online, would that be acceptable? Was it in 1996?</p>

<p>Any data journalist who wants to work with the data, must first scrape it from those hundred pages, which either requires some technical skill and some time, or brute force and quite a lot of time. Even answering simple questions like, “How many names are on the list?” and “What is the average salary?” have to wait for this scraping to be performed.</p>

<p>What about the general public? Even if they&rsquo;ve never heard of scraping a web page, they should still have natural questions like: How many people from each employer is on the list? How much money are CEOs making on average this year? Is that more than last year? How many people on the list are Pathologists?</p>

<p><strong>Easy change</strong></p>

<p>At a minimum, the entire list should be made available for download in a single file in CSV and/or XLS format. This would remove barriers and save time for any data journalist wanting to access the information. This should be trivially easy to do, because by the looks of the URLs, the 2013 (for 2012) disclosure is already stored in a database.</p>

<p><strong>Empower the ecosystem</strong></p>

<p>Not only does this mean that citizens and journalists could better access the data, but it also would enable data visualisation and interaction practitioners to create tools for the entire public to access the information.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Evidence from the Ontario Public Sector Salary Disclosure, the so-called “Sunshine List”, shows that pathologists in Ontario saw an average salary increase in 2013 of 20-25% over the previous year. This average for the entire list was 2.2%.</p>

<p>Appearing in both the 2013 and 2012 disclosures, 195 pathologists saw their average package (salary + taxable benefits) increase by $57k or 20.6% from $280k to $337k.  The top 200 earning pathologists in 2012 averaged $348k, a 25.4% increase over 2011.</p>

<p><strong>Ontario Public Salary Disclosure</strong></p>

<p>Every year since 1996, the Ontario Ministry of Finance has released a list of all public sector employees who earned more than $100,000 in the previous year.</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s happening here? Why are pathologists seeing a 25% raise while the rest of the list shows a very reasonable growth of 2.2%?</p>

<p>At this point all we have are hypotheses. Analysis of the publicly available data has uncovered a surprising feature, and further investigation is required to find the cause. This is exactly the sort of process we should expect from an open government/open data initiative like the Sunshine List.</p>

<p>The top 1,000 employees with the highest package (salary + taxable benefits) in the Ontario Public Sector Salary Disclosure, the so-called “Sunshine List”, saw an average increase of almost $25,000 in 2012 compared to the previous year, an increase of 7.2%, much higher than the bottom half of the 80,000-strong list which saw an increase of only 2.2%.</p>

<p>Is this cause for alarm? Highly paid CEO&rsquo;s are fully in the public spotlight, and the many many school principals have their pay closely monitored, but what about the highly paid individuals near, but not at the top? The data shows that for them, 2012 was a good year.</p>

<p>Every year since 1996, the Ontario Ministry of Finance has released a list of all public sector employees who earned more than $100,000 in the previous year.</p>

<p><strong>Oversight</strong></p>

<p>We can all see that “Sunshine List” champion Thomas Mitchell, President &amp; CEO of Ontario Power Generation took a pay cut this year, but with approaching 100,000 names on the list, more sophisticated, data-drive oversight is possible.</p>

<p>Government-friendly observes point out that the average salary on the list has decreased, just like last year, but that is a red herring. Anyone can add over 9,000 people earning just over $100k to a list with an average salary of $129k and bring down the average. As the list continues to grow from the bottom, we can expect the average salary to decline, without this being any indicator of public fiscal discipline.</p>

<p>Opposition partisans will lament the increasing growth of the list, 9,600 more this year and 7,500 the year before. This is again misleading. The pyramid shape of any organisation tells us that there are more people as you move down the salary brackets. With a perfectly reasonable average salary growth at just over 2.5%, 9,600 employees graduated to the “Sunshine List” this year after having earned around $98k last year. Probably more than 9,600 employees, currently earning around $98k will be new additions to the list next year, and more the year after. Inflation and economic growth will ensure that the list grows, and the pyramid shape will ensure that it grows faster.</p>

<p><strong>Top 1,000</strong></p>

<p>So who are these lucky 1,000 who on average made 7.2% more in 2012?</p>

<p>This year the top 1000 best packages on the list included:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>583 individuals working in hospitals</p>

<ul>
<li><p>176 Pathologists</p></li>
<li><p>50 Chief Executive Officers</p></li>
<li><p>66 Vice-Presidents (Senior, Executive, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>79 Psychiatrists</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>86 employees in electricity</p>

<ul>
<li>56 Vice-Presidents (Senior, Executive, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>144 working at Universities</p>

<ul>
<li>100 Professors</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Big raises</strong></p>

<p>Of the 1,000, 737 can be matched exactly by name and organisation type to last year. 92 of those fortunate souls saw an increase of over 25%! At the top of the pack was Mohamed Abelaziz Elbestawi, Vice-President Research/Professor at McMaster University who was reported as paid salary $266k in 2011 and $506k in 2012! Trung Kien Mai, a Pathologist at The Ottawa Hospital saw his paid salary move from $306k in 2011 to $515k in 2012!</p>

<p>Of those 92 with big raises:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>83 work in hospitals</p></li>
<li><p>50 are Pathologists</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>More questions</strong></p>

<p>At this point, this analysis raises more questions than it answers, but that is to be expected from an analysis of this salary disclosure data. The Public Salary Disclosure Act can help us find questions, not answers.</p>

<p>What we do know is that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Salaries near the top grew substantially</p></li>
<li><p>Those salaries grew much more, even on a % basis than those at the bottom</p></li>
<li><p>Growth was higher than expected given slow economic growth</p></li>
<li><p>Some individuals can be shown to have experienced extraordinary raises</p></li>
<li><p>Pathologists do well, and 2012 was a particularly good year for some</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When it comes to data visualisation design, it&rsquo;s always important to consider your purpose and your audience. Are you trying to convince your audience of a particular point of view? Are you giving your audience an platform from which to explore and find their own insights? In my latest piece I take a step down a less discussed path.</p>

<p>I have created an interactive tool using D3.js that gives the user a chance to see and interact with the typical k-means clustering algorithm from data mining/machine learning. It is my hope, that it will enable students to develop an intuition for how the algorithm works, and a better appreciation of its shortcomings.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&rsquo;s one I had ready to go four weeks ago, but the unreliability of my current web provider got the better of me. This is another piece working from the BBC Price of Football Survey data, only this time mashing it up with league tables available from Wikipedia. I ask where you find the cheapest goals and cheapest wins throughout the English and Scottish Football leagues:</p>

<p>This is again quite similar to the <a href="http://alekseynp.com/portfolio/english-football-tickets-value-for-money.html">English Football Value for Money</a> piece I did previously and is mainly just a data remix with an extra dimension to filter on. It&rsquo;s an interesting way to explore a ranking against two parameters at the same time.</p>

<p>Advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Display a ranking against two parameters simultaneously</p></li>
<li><p>Display both as a ranking as well as relative values. You can easily see both what is higher and lower and also by how much</p></li>
<li><p>Easily compare two teams against both parameters as well as their relative performance against both parameters (i.e. comparing line slopes)</p></li>
<li><p>Easily identify big movers between the two measures</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Slightly complex, so requires the reader to figure it out a bit</p></li>
<li><p>Alternative to showing two rankings at once would be to take a design decision to only show one, that which is deemed most important</p></li>
<li><p>Current solution requires hover which is not mobile-friendly</p></li>
<li><p>Solution is D3.js and therefore SVG and thus IE 7- unfriendly</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Guardian Data Blog has made available for download both the BBC Price of Football Survey data and the Premier League Accounts data, and I thought it would be interesting to mash them up and look for value for money on tickets. I did the analysis and produced the following:</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.com/portfolio/english-football-tickets-value-for-money.html"><strong>English Footbal Tickets: Value For Money</strong></a></p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.com/portfolio/english-football-tickets-value-for-money.html"><img src="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/footievalue.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Click through for the interactive version.</p>

<p>This piece straightforwardly shows both the rankings and the values for the two different ticket types across clubs. By hovering over a club name, or any line, you can see all the data relating to that club, tying the two nicely together. Unfortunately hover is not really available on mobile, so this is not a nice universal solution. Ironically mobile platforms are less interactive in some ways.</p>

<p>This is also my cleanest application of d3.js to date, as I become more comfortable with the library.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The guys over at <a href="http://www.mcfc.co.uk/the-club/mcfc-analytics">MCFC Analytics</a> have released a dataset for the entire 2010-11 English Premier League Football season. This has generated a number of visuals on passing. For the time being, only aggregate by-game data is available for the entire season, but in-game event data for all games should follow. This is my first project, likely in a series on MCFC data.</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.com/portfolio/mcfc-opta-passing-permier-league-2011-12.html"><strong>Passing Direction of Premier League Football Players</strong></a></p>

<p>This visualisation is an excellent tool for <strong>outlier identification</strong>. With players scattered and coloured by position, we can immediately see who the oddballs are. Who are the defenders that pass more like a midfielder? Vise versa? If I were more intimately familiar with the game, this would lead me down a path of investigation to determine what is different about that player. Is it interesting? Is it positive?</p>

<p>Similar analyses carry value in the business world also. A retailer may have many locations and formats, but within those formats are there stores that behave outside of the norm? Do we have large format stores that look more like small format stores in the data? Is there a cost savings opportunity?</p>

<p>In terms of technology, this is another application of <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> and SVG. Unfortunately that means it won&rsquo;t work on browsers IE8 and below. If this piece were to be part of a wide-ranging, consumer-facing project, then a graceful degradation for IE8 would be required. If this were an internal business tool, a particular browser could be mandated (though this unfortunately might be IE8 or below). Since this is a personal project, I choose not to spend the hours to support IE8.</p>
