<time class='entry-date' datetime='2013-04-19T12:40:12-04:00'><span class='date'><span class='date-month'>Apr</span> <span class='date-day'>19</span><span class='date-suffix'>th</span>, <span class='date-year'>2013</span></span> <span class='time'>12:40 pm</span></time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://54.214.234.254/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/graphv2.png"><img src="http://54.214.234.254/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/graphv2.png" alt="graphv2" /></a></p>

<p>The top 1,000 employees with the highest package (salary + taxable benefits) in the Ontario Public Sector Salary Disclosure, the so-called “Sunshine List”, saw an average increase of almost $25,000 in 2012 compared to the previous year, an increase of 7.2%, much higher than the bottom half of the 80,000-strong list which saw an increase of only 2.2%.</p>

<p>Is this cause for alarm? Highly paid CEO&rsquo;s are fully in the public spotlight, and the many many school principals have their pay closely monitored, but what about the highly paid individuals near, but not at the top? The data shows that for them, 2012 was a good year.</p>

<p>Every year since 1996, the Ontario Ministry of Finance has released a list of all public sector employees who earned more than $100,000 in the previous year.</p>

<p><strong>Oversight</strong></p>

<p>We can all see that “Sunshine List” champion Thomas Mitchell, President &amp; CEO of Ontario Power Generation took a pay cut this year, but with approaching 100,000 names on the list, more sophisticated, data-drive oversight is possible.</p>

<p>Government-friendly observes point out that the average salary on the list has decreased, just like last year, but that is a red herring. Anyone can add over 9,000 people earning just over $100k to a list with an average salary of $129k and bring down the average. As the list continues to grow from the bottom, we can expect the average salary to decline, without this being any indicator of public fiscal discipline.</p>

<p>Opposition partisans will lament the increasing growth of the list, 9,600 more this year and 7,500 the year before. This is again misleading. The pyramid shape of any organisation tells us that there are more people as you move down the salary brackets. With a perfectly reasonable average salary growth at just over 2.5%, 9,600 employees graduated to the “Sunshine List” this year after having earned around $98k last year. Probably more than 9,600 employees, currently earning around $98k will be new additions to the list next year, and more the year after. Inflation and economic growth will ensure that the list grows, and the pyramid shape will ensure that it grows faster.</p>

<p><strong>Top 1,000</strong></p>

<p>So who are these lucky 1,000 who on average made 7.2% more in 2012?</p>

<p>This year the top 1000 best packages on the list included:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>583 individuals working in hospitals</p>

<ul>
<li><p>176 Pathologists</p></li>
<li><p>50 Chief Executive Officers</p></li>
<li><p>66 Vice-Presidents (Senior, Executive, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>79 Psychiatrists</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>86 employees in electricity</p>

<ul>
<li>56 Vice-Presidents (Senior, Executive, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>144 working at Universities</p>

<ul>
<li>100 Professors</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Big raises</strong></p>

<p>Of the 1,000, 737 can be matched exactly by name and organisation type to last year. 92 of those fortunate souls saw an increase of over 25%! At the top of the pack was Mohamed Abelaziz Elbestawi, Vice-President Research/Professor at McMaster University who was reported as paid salary $266k in 2011 and $506k in 2012! Trung Kien Mai, a Pathologist at The Ottawa Hospital saw his paid salary move from $306k in 2011 to $515k in 2012!</p>

<p>Of those 92 with big raises:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>83 work in hospitals</p></li>
<li><p>50 are Pathologists</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>More questions</strong></p>

<p>At this point, this analysis raises more questions than it answers, but that is to be expected from an analysis of this salary disclosure data. The Public Salary Disclosure Act can help us find questions, not answers.</p>

<p>What we do know is that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Salaries near the top grew substantially</p></li>
<li><p>Those salaries grew much more, even on a % basis than those at the bottom</p></li>
<li><p>Growth was higher than expected given slow economic growth</p></li>
<li><p>Some individuals can be shown to have experienced extraordinary raises</p></li>
<li><p>Pathologists do well, and 2012 was a particularly good year for some</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When it comes to data visualisation design, it&rsquo;s always important to consider your purpose and your audience. Are you trying to convince your audience of a particular point of view? Are you giving your audience an platform from which to explore and find their own insights? In my latest piece I take a step down a less discussed path.</p>

<p>I have created an interactive tool using D3.js that gives the user a chance to see and interact with the typical k-means clustering algorithm from data mining/machine learning. It is my hope, that it will enable students to develop an intuition for how the algorithm works, and a better appreciation of its shortcomings.</p>

<p>You can learn more about k-means clustering <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&rsquo;s one I had ready to go four weeks ago, but the unreliability of my current web provider got the better of me. This is another piece working from the BBC Price of Football Survey data, only this time mashing it up with league tables available from Wikipedia. I ask where you find the cheapest goals and cheapest wins throughout the English and Scottish Football leagues:</p>

<p><a href="http://thinkdatavis.com/portfolio/paid-to-win.html"><strong>Paid to Win</strong></a></p>

<p><a href="http://thinkdatavis.com/portfolio/paid-to-win.html"><img src="http://54.214.234.254/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/paidtowin.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Click through for the interactive version.</p>

<p>This is again quite similar to the <a href="http://thinkdatavis.com/portfolio/english-football-tickets-value-for-money.html">English Football Value for Money</a> piece I did previously and is mainly just a data remix with an extra dimension to filter on. It&rsquo;s an interesting way to explore a ranking against two parameters at the same time.</p>

<p>Advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Display a ranking against two parameters simultaneously</p></li>
<li><p>Display both as a ranking as well as relative values. You can easily see both what is higher and lower and also by how much</p></li>
<li><p>Easily compare two teams against both parameters as well as their relative performance against both parameters (i.e. comparing line slopes)</p></li>
<li><p>Easily identify big movers between the two measures</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Slightly complex, so requires the reader to figure it out a bit</p></li>
<li><p>Alternative to showing two rankings at once would be to take a design decision to only show one, that which is deemed most important</p></li>
<li><p>Current solution requires hover which is not mobile-friendly</p></li>
<li><p>Solution is D3.js and therefore SVG and thus IE 7- unfriendly</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Guardian Data Blog has made available for download both the BBC Price of Football Survey data and the Premier League Accounts data, and I thought it would be interesting to mash them up and look for value for money on tickets. I did the analysis and produced the following:</p>

<p><a href="http://thinkdatavis.com/portfolio/english-football-tickets-value-for-money.html"><strong>English Footbal Tickets: Value For Money</strong></a></p>

<p><a href="http://thinkdatavis.com/portfolio/english-football-tickets-value-for-money.html"><img src="http://54.214.234.254/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/footievalue.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Click through for the interactive version.</p>

<p>This piece straightforwardly shows both the rankings and the values for the two different ticket types across clubs. By hovering over a club name, or any line, you can see all the data relating to that club, tying the two nicely together. Unfortunately hover is not really available on mobile, so this is not a nice universal solution. Ironically mobile platforms are less interactive in some ways.</p>

<p>This is also my cleanest application of d3.js to date, as I become more comfortable with the library.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The guys over at <a href="http://www.mcfc.co.uk/the-club/mcfc-analytics">MCFC Analytics</a> have released a dataset for the entire 2010-11 English Premier League Football season. This has generated a number of visuals on passing. For the time being, only aggregate by-game data is available for the entire season, but in-game event data for all games should follow. This is my first project, likely in a series on MCFC data.</p>

<p><a href="http://thinkdatavis.com/portfolio/mcfc-opta-passing-permier-league-2011-12.html"><strong>Passing Direction of Premier League Football Players</strong></a></p>

<p><a href="http://thinkdatavis.com/portfolio/mcfc-opta-passing-permier-league-2011-12.html"><img src="http://54.214.234.254/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/passingDirection1.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>This visualisation is an excellent tool for <strong>outlier identification</strong>. With players scattered and coloured by position, we can immediately see who the oddballs are. Who are the defenders that pass more like a midfielder? Vise versa? If I were more intimately familiar with the game, this would lead me down a path of investigation to determine what is different about that player. Is it interesting? Is it positive?</p>

<p>Similar analyses carry value in the business world also. A retailer may have many locations and formats, but within those formats are there stores that behave outside of the norm? Do we have large format stores that look more like small format stores in the data? Is there a cost savings opportunity?</p>

<p>In terms of technology, this is another application of <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> and SVG. Unfortunately that means it won&rsquo;t work on browsers IE8 and below. If this piece were to be part of a wide-ranging, consumer-facing project, then a graceful degradation for IE8 would be required. If this were an internal business tool, a particular browser could be mandated (though this unfortunately might be IE8 or below). Since this is a personal project, I choose not to spend the hours to support IE8.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I <a href="http://thinkdatavis.com/new-project-global-games-regional-sports-london-2012/">previously posted</a> a project I worked on for the London 2012 Olympics. Well, I did some digging around and I managed to find data for the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics, so I wrangled it into the format I had previously used, made some tweaks, and republished my Global Games, Regional Sports analysis, but this time with different data. Does that make this some kind of data-remix?</p>

<p><strong>Sample Insights</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Biathlon and Cross Country Skiing both move together towards Northern Europe when switching from participants to medals. Due to similarities in the sports, we would expect them to be linked.</p></li>
<li><p>Skeleton is most southern in participants due largely to Kiwi competitors, but as they don&rsquo;t win medals it rockets up to the top when switching to medals.</p></li>
<li><p>Four of six ice hockey medals won by Canada and the United States move that sport far to the west. A bad Olympics for European Ice Hockey</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The 2012 London Summer Olympics are over and the medals are tallied. As it is probably the most nationalistic event of the year, we all look to the medal tables to see how our nation did. So, &ldquo;Who won the Olympics?&rdquo;. Like any good question, the answer is: It depends.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve created this visualisation to explore that question: <a href="http://thinkdatavis.com/portfolio/who-won-the-olympics.html">http://thinkdatavis.com/portfolio/who-won-the-olympics.html</a></p>

<p><a href="http://thinkdatavis.com/portfolio/who-won-the-olympics.html"><img src="http://54.214.234.254/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/screenshot.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not as well designed and doesn&rsquo;t have the affordance that I would like, but I&rsquo;m publishing today in its draft form.</p>

<p>Guidance for usage:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The 2x2 space is created by valuing Golds between 1 and 10 Silvers and Bronzes between 0 and 1 Silvers. Depending on where you are in the space, the rankings are different.</p></li>
<li><p>Click a country in the rankings table on the right to see their information and thresholds</p></li>
<li><p>Click a region in the chart to see the ranking that corresponds to that combination of Gold and Bronze valuation.</p></li>
<li><p>Cross a red line to turn it blue and increase the ranking of your selected country. Conversely, cross a blue line to turn it red and decrease the ranking.</p></li>
<li><p>When hovering you can also see the rank for your selected country if you were to click</p></li>
<li><p>When hovering, the darker shaded regions are near to your current in terms of rank for your selected country, the lighter are further.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Clearly the United States came top with more golds, more silvers and more medals than anybody else. China is similarly a sure bet for second. In the standard medals table countries are ranked by number of golds with other medals used to break ties. This is convenient for the host nation, Great Britain, who scored lot&rsquo;s of golds and inconvenient for Russia who didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>So what about those Silvers and Bronzes? Are they worth something? Is a Gold worth three Silvers? Is a Bronze worth half a Silver? These two parameters, the value of a Gold and the value of a Bronze, enable us to create a two-dimensional space to explore. What are the possible different rankings for a given nation? What ranking corresponds to my valuation of medals?</p>

<p>Interesting insights:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For Great Britain to come 3rd, they require gold medals to be worth at least nearly 2 silvers, and if bronzes are worth something, golds may need to be worth as much as 4.5 silvers</p></li>
<li><p>Canada is probably most vulnerable to changes in values compared to any other country. With a huge bronze haul and not much else, Canada could rank as low as 36th or as high as 13th, where either gold medals are nearly everything (36th) or all medals are created equal (13th)</p></li>
<li><p>For many countries, an increasing valuation of golds or bronzes is strictly a good thing, but for some, it actually gets more complex. Iran, for example: high valuations of gold and bronze are generally a bad thing for Iran, except when the value of gold is very high</p></li>
</ul>
