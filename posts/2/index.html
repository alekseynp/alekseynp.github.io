  <div class="entry-content"><p>The major consultancies are turning out to be a goldmine for content for demonstrating the potential for improved data visualisation design. Today&rsquo;s winner is PWC, though their error is not terribly sinful and with some effort one could probably find something worse.</p>

<p>This is a demonstration of the power and importance of left-to-right. The original violates two assumptions readers make about left-to-right:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Things further to the right are later in time</p></li>
<li><p> Things further to the right are higher, bigger, better.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>In the original 2014 is shown to the left of 2013 and the bars are ordered high, medium, low.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/asset-management/emerging-trends-real-estate/european-investment-market-forecast.jhtml">The Original</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/business-prospects.gif"><img src="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/business-prospects.gif" alt="business-prospects" /></a></p>

<p>Quick answers to basic questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Are things good or bad? Bad. The bars make a download sloping shape.</p></li>
<li><p>Are things better or worse than last year? Hard to tell.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>What if we simply change the left-to-right ordering of everything?</p>

<p>Left-to-right changes:</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/business-prospects_v2.gif"><img src="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/business-prospects_v2.gif" alt="business-prospects_v2" /></a></p>

<p>So now we at least get the impression that things are good before we start studying the labeling in detail. We can also scan across, say, the red bars in order to see how things are changing with time without having to realize that the chart&rsquo;s timeline is backwards.</p>

<p>I also experimented with a line design here:</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/pwc2.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/pwc2.png" alt="pwc2" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Maybe the &ldquo;things are good&rdquo; message is a little muted</p></li>
<li><p>We can certainly see the trends over time, though. Generally flat, but with fewer doubters and a bit more optimists.</p></li>
<li><p>The central story of the graphic becomes the crossed lines in Business headcount. Unfortunately this is probably indicating an error in the original graphic. Scroll up and see the probably incorrect data labels</p></li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another day, another poor visual. Apparently I have a quest to complete against bad visuals from consultancies. Today it&rsquo;s KPMG from this tweet:
<a href="https://twitter.com/KPMG/status/434401678931263488">https://twitter.com/KPMG/status/434401678931263488</a></p>

<p>A 4x4 grid of single-value donuts? Are you kidding?</p>

<p>Like <a href="http://alekseynp.com/2014/02/16/dubious-visuals-in-thought-leadership-from-consultancies/">last time</a>, I will show you how this is bad with simple re-design.</p>

<p>First let&rsquo;s try simply cleaning up the graphic a bit:</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BgdOBnbIAAAJgsj-2.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BgdOBnbIAAAJgsj-2.png" alt="BgdOBnbIAAAJgsj-2" /></a></p>

<p>It looks better already! If I can improve your graphic by erasing the visual elements that you used to encode your data, this is a very bad sign.</p>

<p>And finally the obligatory bar-chart redesign:</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kpmg-data-and-analytics.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kpmg-data-and-analytics.png" alt="kpmg data and analytics" /></a></p>

<p>Extra patterns become visible:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>EMEA generally more pessimistic than Americas, Asia-Pacific of Overall</p></li>
<li><p>EMEA substantially less impressed by More sophisticated/granular insights</p></li>
</ul>


<p>KPMG can <a href="http://alekseynp.com/2014/02/16/dubious-visuals-in-thought-leadership-from-consultancies/">join Accenture</a> on the list of consultancies that should practice better data visualisation, especially when generating thought leadership on the topic of data and anatlytics.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been scraping a lot lately. If data is the new oil, then it&rsquo;s time I started pumping it. I came across this old project of mine from a statistics course in my masters program, dated December 15, 2006. Stubhub today should be a goldmine of data and I hope appropriate data and/or analysis is being passed to the leagues to help them set prices.</p>

<blockquote>**Analysis of the determinants of selling price for Vancouver NHL ticket auctions**

Data was collected for a one month period of auctions completed on eBay, a popular internet auction site, for tickets to see the Vancouver Canucks play at home.  The data was analyzed to determine a good regression model for the selling price per ticket. The most significant indicator was face value, but auctions by sellers with higher feedback scores and transactions that are completed longer before a game also finished with a higher price per ticket. Noteworthy insignificant factors were number of tickets in a lot, the feedback percentage rating for the seller, and the length of the auction.</blockquote>


<h1>Findings</h1>

<p>My most interesting finding would provide guidance to price setting.</p>

<blockquote>Of most interest is the regular game Upper Bowl IV and Upper Bowl V price categories. The eBay market price difference from Ticketmaster is significant and in the case of Upper Bowl V seats, sizable. This indicates that these tickets are priced well below market demand. It would seem that from the consumer’s perspective Upper Bowl IV and V are indistinguishable and the Canucks should seriously consider charging more for these seats.</blockquote>


<p>I also found that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tickets sold further ahead of game day sold for more. There is a fundamental tension in the market for tickets, a time-valued good (after game day a ticket is worth zero). Some shoppers are will pass on an auction hoping to find a better deal later. Some shoppers are willing to pay more for the certainty of having a ticket now. Some sellers want to unload their tickets now before they become worthless. Some sellers will patiently wait out the buyers in order to fetch a higher price. In my data there was a correlation of 0.3 between minimum bid and time until game day. This is evidence  of patient sellers setting and getting higher prices further ahead of game day.</p></li>
<li><p>Feedback rating was a more important factor than feedback percentage. In the marketplace that I studied where most operators were small-scale with 100% positive feedback, their tickets sold at a higher price if they gathered more positive feedback. On the flip-side, big-time operators with only a little less than 100% feedback did not suffer greatly.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of tickets in a lot did not affect selling price per ticket. You would expect four tickets together to be worth more than two separate pairs, and surely they are, but there was not enough evidence in the data, so it is not a strong impact.</p></li>
<li><p>Length of the auction did not have an effect. Longer auctions presumably get seen by more people and therefore sell for more, unless the market is active enough such that a critical mass of buyers will see auctions of short length.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2></h2>

<h1>How I Did It</h1>

<ol>
<li><p> A scraper was written in C# to collect html pages from eBay of completed auctions for Vancouver Canucks tickets</p></li>
<li><p> Extensive regular expression matching was done on the auction&rsquo;s free text in order to determine what game the tickets were for, how many tickets there were, and other factors like where the seats were in the stadium</p></li>
<li><p> Regression models were tried in order to find a good fit</p></li>
<li><p> Regression coefficients were interpreted to draw conclusions</p></li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been coding a lot in R lately. Just thought I&rsquo;d share one example of the insanity.</p>

<p>myList = list(&ldquo;a&rdquo;,&ldquo;b&rdquo;)<br/>
myList[1] == &ldquo;a&rdquo;<br/>
class(myList[1]) == class(&ldquo;a&rdquo;)<br/>
myList[[1]] == &ldquo;a&rdquo;<br/>
class(myList[[1]]) == class(&ldquo;a&rdquo;)<br/>
class(myList)<br/>
class(myList[1])<br/>
class(myList[[1]])<br/>
class(&ldquo;a&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Returns&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>myList = list(&ldquo;a&rdquo;,&ldquo;b&rdquo;)<br/>
myList[1] == &ldquo;a&rdquo;<br/>
[1] TRUE<br/>
class(myList[1]) == class(&ldquo;a&rdquo;)<br/>
[1] FALSE<br/>
myList[[1]] == &ldquo;a&rdquo;<br/>
[1] TRUE<br/>
class(myList[[1]]) == class(&ldquo;a&rdquo;)<br/>
[1] TRUE<br/>
class(myList)<br/>
[1] &ldquo;list&rdquo;<br/>
class(myList[1])<br/>
[1] &ldquo;list&rdquo;<br/>
class(myList[[1]])<br/>
[1] &ldquo;character&rdquo;<br/>
class(&ldquo;a&rdquo;)<br/>
[1] &ldquo;character&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Generally weird but reasonable, except  that myList[1] == &ldquo;a&rdquo; is TRUE even though they are not of the same class.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yet another post on visualising and analysing NBA shot location data using location averaging methods.</p>

<p>Previously I have shown averages by team for all shots taken. What about shots taken by zone? Consider the following two charts:</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/avg_inthepaint_teams.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/avg_inthepaint_teams.png" alt="avg_inthepaint_teams" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/avg_midrange_teams.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/avg_midrange_teams.png" alt="avg_midrange_teams" /></a></p>

<p>Now we can see a level of detail that we couldn&rsquo;t in the average of all shots.</p>

<p>Previously:</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.com/2013/11/05/more-on-averages-shot-locations/"><img src="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/for_and_against_640w1-150x150.png" alt="for_and_against_640w" /></a></p>

<p>Observations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Previously we saw that the GSW were the longest shooters in the league and indeed they were also long shooters in the paint and at midrange. It is not simply that the GSW take a lot of 3s.</p></li>
<li><p>Other teams like the NYK take shots from close up in both the paint and at midrange. They were generally longer shooters in the previous analysis, suggesting that they balance those close 2-pts with many 3-pt attempts</p></li>
<li><p>Previously we saw DEN as the closest shooters overall, and indeed they appear to be close shooters in the paint and moderately close shooters at midrange.</p></li>
</ul>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>On average, players in the NBA take shots 6.5% further from the basket in the 4th period than in the 1st. This is a subtle, but consistent trend across all periods. 1.2% further in the 2nd than the 1st, 2.4% further in the 3rd than the 2nd, and 2.7% further in the 4th than the 3rd.</p>

<p>Most teams show the same trend, consider the graphic Average Distance of Shots by Period below:</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/avg_distance_period_allteams.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/avg_distance_period_allteams.png" alt="avg_distance_period_allteams" /></a></p>

<p>Nearly all teams show an increasing distance by period, but there are some notable exceptions. A few teams like NYK, UTA, ATL, and ORL show an opposite trend.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not clear at this point what is leading this. Greater defense in later periods forces further shots? A greater need for 3-pts pushes shots away from the basket? A greater need for points in less time forces less ideal shots from further out? What about the exceptional teams where they get closer? What are these teams doing in the 4th quarter? Leaning more heavily on particular strengths or players?  Tired players not driving to the net?</p>

<p>What is true at the global level and largely true at the team level is again reflected in the players. Here are the average distance for the top 100 scorers:</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/avg_distance_period_100players.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/avg_distance_period_100players.png" alt="avg_distance_period_100players" /></a></p>

<p>More noise, but the trend is still visible!</p>

<p>Average Location of Shots Made - NBA 2012-13 Regular Season by teams and against teams&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/for_and_against_640w1.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/for_and_against_640w1.png" alt="for_and_against_640w" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Shots made by a team show more variation than shots made against a team. Where you shoot from depends more on who you are than who you are playing against &ndash; fine.</p></li>
<li><p>A lot more front-back variation than side-to-side, probably to be expected</p></li>
<li><p>Shots made by MIN, DET, SAS close to the net and DAL, GSW, NYK far away somewhat interesting. Fairly big difference here actually which can probably be chalked up to specific players</p></li>
<li><p>Shots made <em>against</em> probably more interesting. MIL way down at the bottom, GSW significantly at the top. What about these teams&#8217; defensive style means they are more inclined to allow shots close or far from the net?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Sketch (not poblished):</p>

<p>Average Shot Location by Team by Win/Loss - NBA Regular Season 2012-13</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sketch_wins_losses_byteam_v22.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sketch_wins_losses_byteam_v22.png" alt="sketch_wins_losses_byteam_v2" /></a></p>

<p>Every line represents a team and connects the two points for that team. The white dot for a team is the average location of shots attempted in games that team won. The black dot for a team is the average location of shots attempted in games that team lost.</p>

<p>Analysis:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Most wins and losses points are near one another</p></li>
<li><p>Lines generally do not cross</p></li>
<li><p>There are a number of teams across the middle of the chart who attempt shots closer to the net more often when they win</p></li>
<li><p>Variation is left/right variation is probably just statistical noise</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Same chart but filtering for only successful shots&hellip; same story, though less evidence that closer shots are important for winning:</p>

<p>We could also look at the games for an individual team&hellip; and I think learn nothing:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here are two updated charts following up from my<a href="http://alekseynp.com/2013/10/13/average-made-shot-location-nba-regular-season-2012-13/"> previous post</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/wgtavg_made_location_top50scorers_201213_regular.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/wgtavg_made_location_top50scorers_201213_regular.png" alt="wgtavg_made_location_top50scorers_201213_regular" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avg_made_location_top50scorers_201213_regular.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/avg_made_location_top50scorers_201213_regular.png" alt="avg_made_location_top50scorers_201213_regular" /></a></p>

<p>What&rsquo;s new?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The players included are no longer someone else&#8217; list of 50 notable players, but rather the 50 players who scored the most points in the 2012-13 regular season</p></li>
<li><p>More of the courts lines have been included to provide greater context to the data</p></li>
<li><p>The first chart shows the average position that points are scored from. This is a weighted average that puts more emphasis on 3 pointers and further demonstrates how exceptional Stephen Curry is, as the guys at <a href="http://regressing.deadspin.com/stephen-currys-numbers-are-as-unlikely-and-wonderful-a-1449057524">deadspin have noted</a></p></li>
<li><p>The second chart shows the average position of made shots as per the original</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Collaboration</strong></p>

<p>Collaboration is an important thing. Earlier with my weak knowledge of basketball I published what I thought would be an interesting visual <a href="http://alekseynp.com/2013/10/13/average-made-shot-location-nba-regular-season-2012-13/">here</a>. Seems I was correct. But with a little conversation with the guys at <a href="deadspin.com">deadspin.com</a>, some very easy improvements could be made.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sports is full of spacial data. Data visualizers love this. Take the points and plot them by x and y location. Instantly the data is in a format that we can relate to and gain insight from. Too many data points? Aggregate and count points by region to create a head map or something similar. Want to compare two sets of points? Put two charts side-by-side. All of this is done with NBA shot position, but it has its shortcomings.</p>

<p>At stats.nba.com you can see shot charts like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://stats.nba.com/playerShotchart.html?PlayerID=201142&amp;viewShots=true&amp;zoneDetails=false&amp;zoneOverlays=false"><img src="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/short_chart_thumbnail.png" alt="short_chart_thumbnail" /></a> <a href="http://stats.nba.com/playerShotchart.html?PlayerID=201142&amp;viewShots=false&amp;zoneDetails=true&amp;zoneOverlays=true&amp;zone-mode=zone"><img src="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shot_chart_thumbnail2.png" alt="shot_chart_thumbnail2" /></a></p>

<p>At hotshotcharts.com you can see shot charts heated by success rate:</p>

<p><a href="http://hotshotcharts.com/"><img src="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shot_chart_thumbnail3.png" alt="shot_chart_thumbnail3" /></a></p>

<p>Even at the much (rightly) worshiped New York Times they&rsquo;re doing charts like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/06/11/sports/basketball/nba-shot-analysis.html?_r=0"><img src="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shot_chart_thumbnail4.png" alt="shot_chart_thumbnail4" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Shotcomings</strong></p>

<p>I would say that the number one shortcoming of these charts is the difficultly in comparing two sets of points. Take the New York Times piece for example. Try to compare the Heat to the Thunder or the various pairs of players side-by-side. Your eyes will flick back and forth and maybe you&rsquo;ll find a difference, but it&rsquo;s hard and you can&rsquo;t help but feel that you are missing something.</p>

<p>Why? Too much data. The points are not together for easy comparison.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>What I am experimenting with is greater use of aggregation in these circumstances. What if we take average positions to aggregate thousands of data points and then plot those averages together to gain insights?</p>

<p>Here is <a href="http://alekseynp.com/2013/10/13/average-made-shot-location-nba-regular-season-2012-13/">my first piece</a> on basketball:</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/final.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/final-298x300.png" alt="final" /></a></p>

<p>Unfortunately the concept of average location is a bit abstract, and thus that creates a greater overhead of effort for the viewer to overcome before they start getting value out of the graphic. However, after that we can start to compare players in a way that we never have before.
