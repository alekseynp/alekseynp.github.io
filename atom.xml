<p>I used NGRAIN&rsquo;s Constructor SDK to put together a simple visualization of the distribution of confirmed exoplanets relative to Earth.</p>

<p>By no means a feature-rich interactive visualization, it&rsquo;s simple, powerful, and interesting.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/bigRandomCube-300x266.png" alt="bigRandomCube" />Yesterday, I released a simple plugin, <a href="https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/random-3d-layout/">Random 3D Layout t</a>o the  Gephi Marketplace <a href="https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/random-3d-layout/">here</a>. It&rsquo;s very simple, and I developed it as part of my work at <a href="http://www.ngrain.com">NGRAIN</a>.</p>

<p>For anyone working in 3D in Gephi, this will be a useful and simple initialization layout plugin. Works well with the <a href="https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/force-atlas-3d/">Force Atlas 3D Plugin</a>. Without it and using a 2D layout to initialize instead, the 3D results can sometimes be milky-way-shaped, not generally spherical as you would expect, and ultimately not taking full advantage of the third dimension.</p>

<blockquote>As Augmented Reality (AR) continues to gain strong momentum, it is clear that data and information now have a physical 3D context, both conceptually and at the point of display. In the past, we were content with excellent 2-dimensional solutions for 2-dimensional displays, free to ignore 3D data viz as fraught with peril and difficult to execute. At a minimum, we must now wrestle with the challenge of presenting 2D visualizations in a 3D world. And, if we limit ourselves to that, we will fail.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If you don’t look at your data it can deceive you. That was true in two dimensions and is true above. If we live in a world of bivariate visualization we will miss important complex patterns because we are not looking for them. The third dimension must be considered when using visualization in analysis just as it must be rejected as a means to jazz up uninspiring pie charts.</blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s worth announcing that last month I took a position as Data Visualization Lead at <a href="http://www.ngrain.com/">NGRAIN</a> in Vancouver, Canada.</p>

<p>NGRAIN&rsquo;s vision is to see beyond reality, and to help people accelerate decisions by interacting with the world&rsquo;s data in 3D. To make that concrete, we are currently developing cutting edge Augmented Reality applications for the industrial enterprise. 3D data visualization is notoriously difficult to execute, but in Augmented Reality we will no longer have a choice but to confront it, as our reality is 3D. Bringing my expertise to this problem will be an exciting challenge and will require great care.</p>

<p>What you see here will continue to be my own views and not those of NGRAIN. I will, however, likely be publishing on NGRAIN&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ngrain.com/blog/">blog</a> and cross-promoting here.</p>

    <id>http://alekseynp.github.io/2014/03/28/i-tried-to-sell-open-government-data</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I tried to sell open government data, but I won&rsquo;t be the only one.</p>

<p>In 2013 I wrote a series of data journalism articles on the topic of <a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/topic-ontario-public-salary-disclosure/">Ontario Public Sector Salary Disclosure</a>. The posts were based on data made available as part of a disclosure initiative in the Canadian province of Ontario. Data was published freely and openly on the Ontario Ministry of Finance website in html and pdf format. I performed a convoluted scraping and processing exercise to build a definitive, unified data set and then performed some analysis in order to identify some interesting headlines.</p>

<p>In late 2013 I was approached by someone who was looking for the data behind my analysis. I agreed to share the data on a few conditions, one of which was non-commercial use that they were unable to meet. And so I offered to sell them the data. Free, open, public data.</p>

<blockquote>Sorry Aleksey. Not going to pay for public data even if private hours went into scraping it.</blockquote>


<p>I knew I had entered a moral landscape with shades of grey on a topic that people would be emotional about.</p>

<p>Government data should be free and open! After all it&rsquo;s our data for us! Well except perhaps in instances where user fees would be a more appropriate measure to spread the cost of data production more proportionally to those who will benefit. And the shades are grey.</p>

<p>My simplest and most direct defense is: My customer knew that the data was freely available, but I still had something to sell them.</p>

<p>Nobody owns the truth, but once they have measured it, processed it, and made it available in a useful format, then they have something that they could sell to you. If I sold you a map based on free government data or delivered you a service based on it, you would accept that.</p>

<p>I wrote about the <a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/2013/05/28/data-sins-of-the-ontario-ministry-of-finance-public-sector-salary-disclosure/">Data Sins of the Ontario Ministry of Finance – Public Sector Salary Disclosure</a> and <a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/2013/04/22/current-publishing-of-ontario-sunshine-list-not-good-enough/">Current publishing of Ontario “Sunshine List” not good enough</a>. This data was &ldquo;open&rdquo; but not truly &ldquo;open&rdquo; and it required considerable effort to process before I could analyse it.</p>

<p><strong>ProPublica</strong></p>

<p>Why I wrote this today rather than continue to procrastinate is that I saw this: <a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/introducing-the-propublica-data-store">Introducing the ProPublica Data Store</a></p>

<blockquote>For datasets that are the result of significant expenditures of our time and effort, we&#8217;re charging a reasonable one-time fee: In most cases, it&#8217;s $200 for journalists and $2,000 for academic researchers. Those wanting to use data commercially should reach out to us to discuss pricing.</blockquote>


<p>And relevantly, they have data sets for sale based on data acquired through the American Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<p>Regarding:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbTb62BeTUc"> SAP Visual Intelligence: Big Data Example </a>on YouTube</p>

<p>First I had better say the positive things. I appreciate that this is a feature demonstration and not a case study. The presenter goes through the feature set of their product in an admirable and straightforward way. It is an impressive feature set and an impressive product. They are not trying to tell a story, so it is unfair to criticize their story.</p>

<p>Then I can say the &ldquo;but&rdquo;. But! I was struck by the badness of the visualizations. ALL of them! Some highlights are below, but you can watch the video for yourself and see not one well purposed chart.</p>

<p>The Visual Analytics movement seeks to democratize data analysis by making it easy to use and highly visual. They want to push analysis up towards senior management and outwards away from the analysts. Which is a laudable goal, but when we get there and people are creating stuff like we see in this video, we will have failed.</p>

<p>This illustrates two major calls to action:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Designers: How do you design a Visual Analytics product that guides its users to make good data viz design decisions?</p></li>
<li><p> Trainers: Go out there and spread the good word. Time to get <a href="http://visualisingdata.com/">Andy Kirk</a> in to train your organization!</p></li>

    <link href="http://alekseynp.github.io/2014/03/20/american-social-mobility-npr-and-commentary/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-20T00:40:50-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://alekseynp.github.io/2014/03/20/american-social-mobility-npr-and-commentary</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Regarding: <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/03/18/289013884/who-had-richer-parents-doctors-or-arists">Who Had Richer Parents, Doctors Or Artists? : Planet Money : NPR</a></p>

<p>First of all, hats off to them for asking and answering important questions about modern society. The tldr; is that they ask &ldquo;Who had richer parents, journalists or people working in finance? Doctors or artists? More generally: What&rsquo;s the link between household income during childhood and job choice during adulthood?&rdquo; and based on a US government survey, they produced an answer.</p>

<p>They generate two elegant charts to illustrate their findings and I invite you to go to the article and see.</p>

<p>But something irked me about all of it and it took me some time to put my finger on it and ultimately it was the lack of extra commentary.</p>

<p>The first chart is a simple message: Doctors earn a lot more than their parents. Designers a lot less. But this isn&rsquo;t all that surprising given that we know what doctors earn quite a lot of money and designers don&rsquo;t. Even in a purely egalitarian society with 100% social mobility we would expect this. All of this tells us is that there is at least some social mobility. Not all rich doctors are born of rich doctor families.</p>

<p>The second chart is delightfully complex for journalism, but I felt even I, as a trained analyst, was struggling to get the right message out of it. Either I&rsquo;m having an off day, I think too highly of myself, or the readers are going to need some help.</p>

<p>Enter my adjustment:</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/social_mobility_final.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/social_mobility_final.png" alt="social_mobility_final" /></a></p>

<p>I&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&hellip; expanded the axes to include the full income distribution</p></li>
<li><p>&hellip; labeled the X=Y line for what it was</p></li>
<li><p>&hellip; added a Y=50 line to put the data into better context</p></li>
<li><p>&hellip; hand guestimated a line of best fit for the points so we could see where the United States sits</p></li>
<li><p>&hellip; made an important point about the lack of professions in the region left out of the original graphic</p></li>
</ul>


<p>An important and complicated question to answer is still missing: Nurses, for example, come of households at the 50th percentile. But is this all nurses coming from households all at the 50th percentile? Or nurses coming from households with incomes across the entire range, who on average are at the 50th percentile? If we knew the answer to that, then we would really start to learn about the potential for social mobility.</p>

<p>Ultimately they say that, &ldquo;These graphs aren&rsquo;t intended to answer broader questions about inequality and social mobility.&rdquo; But I don&rsquo;t see why they shouldn&rsquo;t be part of the debate.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My US GDP/&ldquo;Population&rdquo; Map</p>

<p>Yes, the quality on this is not super high, but the point is to experiment with an idea.</p>

<p>There has been a lot of controversy floating around about a map.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2014/02/defending-the-incredible-gdp-map/">Visualising Data</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://andywoodruff.com/blog/its-just-a-population-map/">Andrew Woodruff</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2014/02/the-incredible-gdp-map-that-shows-that.html">The Functional Art</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>&hellip; to name a few.</p>

<p>The map being this: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/1y371s/">http://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/1y371s/</a></p>

<p>I have a thing for trying out abstract ideas in spacial analysis. Like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/2013/10/14/visualising-shot-location-in-basketball/">NBA Basketball</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/2012/08/14/new-project-global-games-regional-sports-london-2012/">Olympic Medals</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p>As a western Canadian, I&rsquo;m very aware of the east-west dynamics in the US and Canada, so I thought I would follow a hunch and make this map. I think it demonstrates nicely how lop-sided the US is.</p>

    <link href="http://alekseynp.github.io/2014/02/17/left-and-right-are-important/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-17T17:05:54-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://alekseynp.github.io/2014/02/17/left-and-right-are-important</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The major consultancies are turning out to be a goldmine for content for demonstrating the potential for improved data visualisation design. Today&rsquo;s winner is PWC, though their error is not terribly sinful and with some effort one could probably find something worse.</p>

<p>This is a demonstration of the power and importance of left-to-right. The original violates two assumptions readers make about left-to-right:</p>

<ol>
<li><p> Things further to the right are later in time</p></li>
<li><p> Things further to the right are higher, bigger, better.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>In the original 2014 is shown to the left of 2013 and the bars are ordered high, medium, low.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/asset-management/emerging-trends-real-estate/european-investment-market-forecast.jhtml">The Original</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/business-prospects.gif"><img src="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/business-prospects.gif" alt="business-prospects" /></a></p>

<p>Quick answers to basic questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Are things good or bad? Bad. The bars make a download sloping shape.</p></li>
<li><p>Are things better or worse than last year? Hard to tell.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>What if we simply change the left-to-right ordering of everything?</p>

<p>Left-to-right changes:</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/business-prospects_v2.gif"><img src="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/business-prospects_v2.gif" alt="business-prospects_v2" /></a></p>

<p>So now we at least get the impression that things are good before we start studying the labeling in detail. We can also scan across, say, the red bars in order to see how things are changing with time without having to realize that the chart&rsquo;s timeline is backwards.</p>

<p>I also experimented with a line design here:</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/pwc2.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/pwc2.png" alt="pwc2" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Maybe the &ldquo;things are good&rdquo; message is a little muted</p></li>
<li><p>We can certainly see the trends over time, though. Generally flat, but with fewer doubters and a bit more optimists.</p></li>
<li><p>The central story of the graphic becomes the crossed lines in Business headcount. Unfortunately this is probably indicating an error in the original graphic. Scroll up and see the probably incorrect data labels</p></li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another day, another poor visual. Apparently I have a quest to complete against bad visuals from consultancies. Today it&rsquo;s KPMG from this tweet:
<a href="https://twitter.com/KPMG/status/434401678931263488">https://twitter.com/KPMG/status/434401678931263488</a></p>

<p>A 4x4 grid of single-value donuts? Are you kidding?</p>

<p>Like <a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/2014/02/16/dubious-visuals-in-thought-leadership-from-consultancies/">last time</a>, I will show you how this is bad with simple re-design.</p>

<p>First let&rsquo;s try simply cleaning up the graphic a bit:</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BgdOBnbIAAAJgsj-2.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BgdOBnbIAAAJgsj-2.png" alt="BgdOBnbIAAAJgsj-2" /></a></p>

<p>It looks better already! If I can improve your graphic by erasing the visual elements that you used to encode your data, this is a very bad sign.</p>

<p>And finally the obligatory bar-chart redesign:</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kpmg-data-and-analytics.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/kpmg-data-and-analytics.png" alt="kpmg data and analytics" /></a></p>

<p>Extra patterns become visible:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>EMEA generally more pessimistic than Americas, Asia-Pacific of Overall</p></li>
<li><p>EMEA substantially less impressed by More sophisticated/granular insights</p></li>
</ul>


<p>KPMG can <a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/2014/02/16/dubious-visuals-in-thought-leadership-from-consultancies/">join Accenture</a> on the list of consultancies that should practice better data visualisation, especially when generating thought leadership on the topic of data and anatlytics.</p>

    <id>http://alekseynp.github.io/2014/02/15/analysis-of-the-determinants-of-selling-price-for-vancouver-nhl-ticket-auctions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been scraping a lot lately. If data is the new oil, then it&rsquo;s time I started pumping it. I came across this old project of mine from a statistics course in my masters program, dated December 15, 2006. Stubhub today should be a goldmine of data and I hope appropriate data and/or analysis is being passed to the leagues to help them set prices.</p>

<blockquote>**Analysis of the determinants of selling price for Vancouver NHL ticket auctions**

Data was collected for a one month period of auctions completed on eBay, a popular internet auction site, for tickets to see the Vancouver Canucks play at home.  The data was analyzed to determine a good regression model for the selling price per ticket. The most significant indicator was face value, but auctions by sellers with higher feedback scores and transactions that are completed longer before a game also finished with a higher price per ticket. Noteworthy insignificant factors were number of tickets in a lot, the feedback percentage rating for the seller, and the length of the auction.</blockquote>


<h1>Findings</h1>

<p>My most interesting finding would provide guidance to price setting.</p>

<blockquote>Of most interest is the regular game Upper Bowl IV and Upper Bowl V price categories. The eBay market price difference from Ticketmaster is significant and in the case of Upper Bowl V seats, sizable. This indicates that these tickets are priced well below market demand. It would seem that from the consumer’s perspective Upper Bowl IV and V are indistinguishable and the Canucks should seriously consider charging more for these seats.</blockquote>


<p>I also found that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tickets sold further ahead of game day sold for more. There is a fundamental tension in the market for tickets, a time-valued good (after game day a ticket is worth zero). Some shoppers are will pass on an auction hoping to find a better deal later. Some shoppers are willing to pay more for the certainty of having a ticket now. Some sellers want to unload their tickets now before they become worthless. Some sellers will patiently wait out the buyers in order to fetch a higher price. In my data there was a correlation of 0.3 between minimum bid and time until game day. This is evidence  of patient sellers setting and getting higher prices further ahead of game day.</p></li>
<li><p>Feedback rating was a more important factor than feedback percentage. In the marketplace that I studied where most operators were small-scale with 100% positive feedback, their tickets sold at a higher price if they gathered more positive feedback. On the flip-side, big-time operators with only a little less than 100% feedback did not suffer greatly.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of tickets in a lot did not affect selling price per ticket. You would expect four tickets together to be worth more than two separate pairs, and surely they are, but there was not enough evidence in the data, so it is not a strong impact.</p></li>
<li><p>Length of the auction did not have an effect. Longer auctions presumably get seen by more people and therefore sell for more, unless the market is active enough such that a critical mass of buyers will see auctions of short length.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2></h2>

<h1>How I Did It</h1>

<ol>
<li><p> A scraper was written in C# to collect html pages from eBay of completed auctions for Vancouver Canucks tickets</p></li>
<li><p> Extensive regular expression matching was done on the auction&rsquo;s free text in order to determine what game the tickets were for, how many tickets there were, and other factors like where the seats were in the stadium</p></li>
<li><p> Regression models were tried in order to find a good fit</p></li>
<li><p> Regression coefficients were interpreted to draw conclusions</p></li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been coding a lot in R lately. Just thought I&rsquo;d share one example of the insanity.</p>

<p>myList = list(&ldquo;a&rdquo;,&ldquo;b&rdquo;)<br/>

class(myList[1]) == class(&ldquo;a&rdquo;)<br/>
myList[[1]] == &ldquo;a&rdquo;<br/>
class(myList[[1]]) == class(&ldquo;a&rdquo;)<br/>
class(myList)<br/>
class(myList[1])<br/>
class(myList[[1]])<br/>
class(&ldquo;a&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Returns&hellip;</p>

<blockquote><p>myList = list(&ldquo;a&rdquo;,&ldquo;b&rdquo;)<br/>
myList[1] == &ldquo;a&rdquo;<br/>
[1] TRUE<br/>
class(myList[1]) == class(&ldquo;a&rdquo;)<br/>
[1] FALSE<br/>
myList[[1]] == &ldquo;a&rdquo;<br/>
[1] TRUE<br/>
class(myList[[1]]) == class(&ldquo;a&rdquo;)<br/>
[1] TRUE<br/>

[1] &ldquo;list&rdquo;<br/>
class(myList[1])<br/>

[1] &ldquo;character&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Generally weird but reasonable, except  that myList[1] == &ldquo;a&rdquo; is TRUE even though they are not of the same class.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yet another post on visualising and analysing NBA shot location data using location averaging methods.</p>

<p>Previously I have shown averages by team for all shots taken. What about shots taken by zone? Consider the following two charts:</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/avg_inthepaint_teams.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/avg_inthepaint_teams.png" alt="avg_inthepaint_teams" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/avg_midrange_teams.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/avg_midrange_teams.png" alt="avg_midrange_teams" /></a></p>

<p>Now we can see a level of detail that we couldn&rsquo;t in the average of all shots.</p>

<p>Previously:</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/2013/11/05/more-on-averages-shot-locations/"><img src="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/for_and_against_640w1-150x150.png" alt="for_and_against_640w" /></a></p>

<p>Observations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Previously we saw that the GSW were the longest shooters in the league and indeed they were also long shooters in the paint and at midrange. It is not simply that the GSW take a lot of 3s.</p></li>
<li><p>Other teams like the NYK take shots from close up in both the paint and at midrange. They were generally longer shooters in the previous analysis, suggesting that they balance those close 2-pts with many 3-pt attempts</p></li>
<li><p>Previously we saw DEN as the closest shooters overall, and indeed they appear to be close shooters in the paint and moderately close shooters at midrange.</p></li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://alekseynp.github.io/2013/11/07/nba-players-shoot-from-further-as-the-game-progresses/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-07T16:02:15-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://alekseynp.github.io/2013/11/07/nba-players-shoot-from-further-as-the-game-progresses</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On average, players in the NBA take shots 6.5% further from the basket in the 4th period than in the 1st. This is a subtle, but consistent trend across all periods. 1.2% further in the 2nd than the 1st, 2.4% further in the 3rd than the 2nd, and 2.7% further in the 4th than the 3rd.</p>

<p>Most teams show the same trend, consider the graphic Average Distance of Shots by Period below:</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/avg_distance_period_allteams.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/avg_distance_period_allteams.png" alt="avg_distance_period_allteams" /></a></p>

<p>Nearly all teams show an increasing distance by period, but there are some notable exceptions. A few teams like NYK, UTA, ATL, and ORL show an opposite trend.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not clear at this point what is leading this. Greater defense in later periods forces further shots? A greater need for 3-pts pushes shots away from the basket? A greater need for points in less time forces less ideal shots from further out? What about the exceptional teams where they get closer? What are these teams doing in the 4th quarter? Leaning more heavily on particular strengths or players?  Tired players not driving to the net?</p>

<p>What is true at the global level and largely true at the team level is again reflected in the players. Here are the average distance for the top 100 scorers:</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/avg_distance_period_100players.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/avg_distance_period_100players.png" alt="avg_distance_period_100players" /></a></p>

<p>More noise, but the trend is still visible!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are some more visuals based on my analysis of average shot locations from the NBA Regular Season 2012-13&hellip;</p>

<p>See previously:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/2013/10/13/average-made-shot-location-nba-regular-season-2012-13/">Average Made Shot Location - NBA Regular Season 2012-13</a></p></li>

</ul>


<p>Average Location of Shots Made - NBA 2012-13 Regular Season by teams and against teams&hellip;</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/for_and_against_640w1.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/for_and_against_640w1.png" alt="for_and_against_640w" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Shots made by a team show more variation than shots made against a team. Where you shoot from depends more on who you are than who you are playing against &ndash; fine.</p></li>
<li><p>A lot more front-back variation than side-to-side, probably to be expected</p></li>
<li><p>Shots made by MIN, DET, SAS close to the net and DAL, GSW, NYK far away somewhat interesting. Fairly big difference here actually which can probably be chalked up to specific players</p></li>
<li><p>Shots made <em>against</em> probably more interesting. MIL way down at the bottom, GSW significantly at the top. What about these teams&#8217; defensive style means they are more inclined to allow shots close or far from the net?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Sketch (not poblished):</p>

<p>Average Shot Location by Team by Win/Loss - NBA Regular Season 2012-13</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sketch_wins_losses_byteam_v22.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sketch_wins_losses_byteam_v22.png" alt="sketch_wins_losses_byteam_v2" /></a></p>

<p>Every line represents a team and connects the two points for that team. The white dot for a team is the average location of shots attempted in games that team won. The black dot for a team is the average location of shots attempted in games that team lost.</p>

<p>Analysis:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Most wins and losses points are near one another</p></li>
<li><p>Lines generally do not cross</p></li>
<li><p>There are a number of teams across the middle of the chart who attempt shots closer to the net more often when they win</p></li>
<li><p>Variation is left/right variation is probably just statistical noise</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Same chart but filtering for only successful shots&hellip; same story, though less evidence that closer shots are important for winning:</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sketch_wins_losses_byteam_made_v2.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sketch_wins_losses_byteam_made_v2.png" alt="sketch_wins_losses_byteam_made_v2" /></a></p>

<p>We could also look at the games for an individual team&hellip; and I think learn nothing:</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s new?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The players included are no longer someone else&#8217; list of 50 notable players, but rather the 50 players who scored the most points in the 2012-13 regular season</p></li>
<li><p>More of the courts lines have been included to provide greater context to the data</p></li>
<li><p>The first chart shows the average position that points are scored from. This is a weighted average that puts more emphasis on 3 pointers and further demonstrates how exceptional Stephen Curry is, as the guys at <a href="http://regressing.deadspin.com/stephen-currys-numbers-are-as-unlikely-and-wonderful-a-1449057524">deadspin have noted</a></p></li>
<li><p>The second chart shows the average position of made shots as per the original</p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Collaboration</strong></p>

<p>Collaboration is an important thing. Earlier with my weak knowledge of basketball I published what I thought would be an interesting visual <a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/2013/10/13/average-made-shot-location-nba-regular-season-2012-13/">here</a>. Seems I was correct. But with a little conversation with the guys at <a href="deadspin.com">deadspin.com</a>, some very easy improvements could be made.</p>

    <updated>2013-10-14T15:30:30-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://alekseynp.github.io/2013/10/14/visualising-shot-location-in-basketball</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sports is full of spacial data. Data visualizers love this. Take the points and plot them by x and y location. Instantly the data is in a format that we can relate to and gain insight from. Too many data points? Aggregate and count points by region to create a head map or something similar. Want to compare two sets of points? Put two charts side-by-side. All of this is done with NBA shot position, but it has its shortcomings.</p>

<p>At stats.nba.com you can see shot charts like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://stats.nba.com/playerShotchart.html?PlayerID=201142&amp;viewShots=true&amp;zoneDetails=false&amp;zoneOverlays=false"><img src="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/short_chart_thumbnail.png" alt="short_chart_thumbnail" /></a> <a href="http://stats.nba.com/playerShotchart.html?PlayerID=201142&amp;viewShots=false&amp;zoneDetails=true&amp;zoneOverlays=true&amp;zone-mode=zone"><img src="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shot_chart_thumbnail2.png" alt="shot_chart_thumbnail2" /></a></p>

<p>At hotshotcharts.com you can see shot charts heated by success rate:</p>

<p><a href="http://hotshotcharts.com/"><img src="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shot_chart_thumbnail3.png" alt="shot_chart_thumbnail3" /></a></p>

<p>Even at the much (rightly) worshiped New York Times they&rsquo;re doing charts like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/06/11/sports/basketball/nba-shot-analysis.html?_r=0"><img src="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shot_chart_thumbnail4.png" alt="shot_chart_thumbnail4" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Shotcomings</strong></p>

<p>I would say that the number one shortcoming of these charts is the difficultly in comparing two sets of points. Take the New York Times piece for example. Try to compare the Heat to the Thunder or the various pairs of players side-by-side. Your eyes will flick back and forth and maybe you&rsquo;ll find a difference, but it&rsquo;s hard and you can&rsquo;t help but feel that you are missing something.</p>

<p>Why? Too much data. The points are not together for easy comparison.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>What I am experimenting with is greater use of aggregation in these circumstances. What if we take average positions to aggregate thousands of data points and then plot those averages together to gain insights?</p>

<p>Here is <a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/2013/10/13/average-made-shot-location-nba-regular-season-2012-13/">my first piece</a> on basketball:</p>

<p><a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/final.png"><img src="http://alekseynp.github.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/final-298x300.png" alt="final" /></a></p>

<p>Unfortunately the concept of average location is a bit abstract, and thus that creates a greater overhead of effort for the viewer to overcome before they start getting value out of the graphic. However, after that we can start to compare players in a way that we never have before. See the first post <a href="http://alekseynp.github.io/2013/10/13/average-made-shot-location-nba-regular-season-2012-13/">here</a>.</p>
