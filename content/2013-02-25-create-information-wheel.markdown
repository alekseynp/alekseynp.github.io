Today I am releasing a tool that allows users to create and export an Information Wheel.  

[Click here](viz/create-visualisations/infowheel4/infoWheel.html) to access the tool.

[![](viz/images/infowheel_blog.png)](viz/create-visualisations/infowheel4/infoWheel.html)  

Users can:
  
  * Define a complete 4-level hierarchy, breaking a concept down to four levels
  
  * Customise ring-sizes
  
  * Customise colouring
  
  * Customsie text
  
  * **Export to SVG**

This is an alpha release of the tool, hopefully the first of many. Any and all feedback is welcome.

Also, if you have the time and ability to do similar or better things, I invite you to contact me regarding collaboration.
