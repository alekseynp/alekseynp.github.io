Here is an [nbviewer IPython notebook showing an analysis of pathologists in the Ontario Sunshine List](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/alekseynp/81a249e5e971750039dc).

It uses data from the [Ontario Sunshine List Scraper](https://github.com/alekseynp/ontario_sunshine_list) that I made public on GitHub recently.

It recreates the analysis that went in to my previous article about pathologists on the list: [20-25% Raise for Ontarioâ€™s Pathologists in 2012](http://alekseynp.com/2013/04/19/20-25-raise-for-ontarios-pathologists-in-201-shows-sunshine-list/)

I hope you'll find it useful.
