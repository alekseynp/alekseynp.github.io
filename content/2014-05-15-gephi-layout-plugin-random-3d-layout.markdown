![bigRandomCube]({filename}/images/bigRandomCube-300x266.png)Yesterday, I released a simple plugin, [Random 3D Layout t](https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/random-3d-layout/)o the  Gephi Marketplace [here](https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/random-3d-layout/). It's very simple, and I developed it as part of my work at [NGRAIN](http://www.ngrain.com).

For anyone working in 3D in Gephi, this will be a useful and simple initialization layout plugin. Works well with the [Force Atlas 3D Plugin](https://marketplace.gephi.org/plugin/force-atlas-3d/). Without it and using a 2D layout to initialize instead, the 3D results can sometimes be milky-way-shaped, not generally spherical as you would expect, and ultimately not taking full advantage of the third dimension.
