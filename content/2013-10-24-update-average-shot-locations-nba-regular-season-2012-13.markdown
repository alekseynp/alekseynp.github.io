Here are two updated charts following up from my[ previous post](average-made-shot-location-nba-regular-season-2012-13.html).

![wgtavg_made_location_top50scorers_201213_regular]({filename}/images/wgtavg_made_location_top50scorers_201213_regular.png)

![avg_made_location_top50scorers_201213_regular]({filename}/images/avg_made_location_top50scorers_201213_regular.png)

What's new?

  * The players included are no longer someone else' list of 50 notable players, but rather the 50 players who scored the most points in the 2012-13 regular season

  * More of the courts lines have been included to provide greater context to the data
	
  * The first chart shows the average position that points are scored from. This is a weighted average that puts more emphasis on 3 pointers and further demonstrates how exceptional Stephen Curry is, as the guys at [deadspin have noted](http://regressing.deadspin.com/stephen-currys-numbers-are-as-unlikely-and-wonderful-a-1449057524)
	
  * The second chart shows the average position of made shots as per the original

**Collaboration**

Collaboration is an important thing. Earlier with my weak knowledge of basketball I published what I thought would be an interesting visual [here](average-made-shot-location-nba-regular-season-2012-13.html). Seems I was correct. But with a little conversation with the guys at [deadspin.com](deadspin.com), some very easy improvements could be made.
