title: New Project: English Football Value for Money
---

The Guardian Data Blog has made available for download both the BBC Price of Football Survey data and the Premier League Accounts data, and I thought it would be interesting to mash them up and look for value for money on tickets. I did the analysis and produced the following:

[**English Footbal Tickets: Value For Money**](viz/english-football-tickets-value-for-money.html)

Click through for the interactive version.

This piece straightforwardly shows both the rankings and the values for the two different ticket types across clubs. By hovering over a club name, or any line, you can see all the data relating to that club, tying the two nicely together. Unfortunately hover is not really available on mobile, so this is not a nice universal solution. Ironically mobile platforms are less interactive in some ways.

This is also my cleanest application of d3.js to date, as I become more comfortable with the library.
