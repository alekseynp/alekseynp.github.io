My teammate, Ross Wightman, and I recently placed 5th in the [Targeted Adversarial Attack](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nips-2017-targeted-adversarial-attack) and 9th in the [Non-targeted Adversarial Attack](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nips-2017-non-targeted-adversarial-attack) competitions hosted on Kaggle as part of the NIPS 2017 competition track.

We've written a paper and it is [available here]({filename}/papers/nips2017-adversarial-paper.pdf).
