Today I am releasing another tool that allows users to create and export a diagram/visualisation. Today it is an Information Tree.  

[Click here](viz/create-visualisations/reingold-Tilford_Tree4/Reingold_Tilford_Tree.html) to access the tool.

Users can:

  * Define a complete 4-level hierarchy, breaking a concept down to four levels

  * Customise some aspects
  
  * **Export to SVG**

This is an alpha release of the tool, hopefully the first of many. Any and all feedback is welcome.

Also, if you have the time and ability to do similar or better things, I invite you to contact me regarding collaboration.
